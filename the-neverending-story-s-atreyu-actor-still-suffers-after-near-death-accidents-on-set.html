Delving deeper into the challenges faced by Noah Hathaway and his peers on the set of The NeverEnding Story, this article reveals the potential lasting impacts of on-set accidents, showcasing that the story of the Atreyu actor is in fact a never-ending one.</p><h2 id=how-filming-39-the-neverending-story-39-almost-killed-atreyu-rsquo-s-noah-hathaway>How Filming 'The NeverEnding Story' Almost Killed Atreyu’s Noah Hathaway</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/noah-hathaway-arteyu.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Noah Hathaway was making his mark in Hollywood long before he landed the role of Atreyu in The NeverEnding Story. Notably, he gained attention for his role as Boxey in the original Battlestar Galactica series, where he played the son of Apollo and Serina. As he transitioned from TV series to more prominent film projects, his commitment and passion for acting became evident, setting the stage for his eventual iconic role in The NeverEnding Story.</p><p>The film tells the tale of a young boy named Bastian Bux, who, while hiding from bullies, stumbles upon a magical book in a bookstore. As he begins to read, he’s drawn into the world of Fantasia, a realm facing doom from a mysterious force called the Nothing. The young warrior Atreyu, portrayed by Noah Hathaway, is chosen to find a cure and save the realm.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gerard-butler-looking-like-he-is-in-pain.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Gerard Butler Has Had Numerous Accidents On Set That Could've Ended His Movie Career</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Gerard Butler does amazing things onscreen and walks away but in real life he is surprisingly accident prone.</span><p>Yet, the challenges faced by Atreyu on-screen paled in comparison to the real-life dangers Noah Hathaway encountered. During a scene that required interaction with a horse, things took a turn for the worse. The horse, frightened and unable to settle down, decided to leap over a fence. However, instead of clearing the obstacle, the horse fell, landing directly on the actor.</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-noah-hathaway-rsquo-s-the-neverending-story-injuries>The Cost Of Noah Hathaway’s The NeverEnding Story Injuries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/noah-hathaway-interview.jpg><p>Noah Hathaway recounted the terrifying accident on The NeverEnding Story set, stating, “The horse didn’t make it over the fence and landed on me.” This mishap resulted in several broken vertebrae for him, which meant an extended stay in the hospital. Reflecting on his experiences, Hathaway shared a bittersweet sentiment, “Parts of filming were some of the best moments of my life, while others were among the worst.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, the consequences of that accident did not end after his hospital release. A 2017 TMZ report highlighted the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">staggering medical bills Hathaway faced</a> over the years. The <a href=#>accumulated costs had reached around $800,000</a>, and he had exhausted his financial resources.</p><p>A spinal fusion surgery had at the time recently added another $184,000 to his debt. Recognizing Hathaway’s dire situation, a kind neighbor took the initiative to establish a GoFundMe account, hoping to raise $200,000 to help the actor manage these overwhelming expenses.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-stunt-coordinators-were-kept-off-set-the-day-of-uma-thurman-s-car-accident-in-kill-bill-despite-the-fact-that-she-didn-t-want-to-shoot-it.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Stunt Coordinators Were Kept Off Set The Day Of Uma Thurman's Car Accident In Kill Bill, Despite The Fact That She Didn't Want To Shoot It</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>A stunt coordinator on Kill Bill made quite the reveal about Uma Thurman's car accident on-set.</span><p>Had the full $200,000 been raised for Hathaway, he planned to allocate the remaining $16,000, after covering his debts, to his dog’s medical needs.

A significant part of the delays stemmed from the on-set accidents involving Noah Hathaway. Brian Johnson, the special effects director for the project, shed light on this in an interview with SciFiNow, per ScreenRant. “Noah Hathaway was a bit of a pain,” stated Johnson. “It was very difficult for Wolfgang to get anything out of him.”</p><p>Hathaway himself provided insight into why he might have been perceived this way. In a separate conversation, he explained, “Well, what it was... [Director] Wolfgang Petersen was notorious for his actors doing their own stunts... [But] that’s why [movie sets usually] have stuntmen.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Hathaway’s accidents weren’t the sole cause of delays. Another considerable hurdle came when filming one of the most emotional scenes in the movie: the Swamp of Sadness. In this scene, Atreyu’s loyal horse Artax drowns, leaving both Atreyu and audiences heartbroken.</p><p>This particular segment was difficult to film due to the unique challenges posed by horses. Typically, the equine beasts wouldn’t willingly submerge themselves in a substance resembling black goo. The original plan was for this scene to be shot in just two weeks. However, training the horse to stand on a submerged platform, and then have it descend, took a whopping seven weeks.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-noah-hathaway-after-playing-atreyu-in-the-neverending-story>What Happened To Noah Hathaway After Playing Atreyu In The NeverEnding Story?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tami-and-noah-neverending-story.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the acclaim and recognition that came with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">playing Atreyu in The NeverEnding Story</a>, Noah Hathaway’s career in Hollywood continued, albeit with its own set of challenges. While his role as Atreyu remains his most iconic, he did take on various other acting roles in the immediate aftermath.</p><p>One of these that he embraced post-Atreyu was in the 1986 movie Troll, where he played Harry Potter Jr., a young boy combating evil creatures. Hathaway would then disappear from the scene for a few years, before returning with a role in the 1994 indie To Die, to Sleep.</p><p>Away from the camera, Hathaway has displayed a remarkable prowess in martial arts. He achieved black belts in both Tang Soo Do and Shotokan Karate. Not just limiting himself to traditional martial arts, he furthered his athleticism by competing as a Muay Thai boxer.</p><p>Hathaway has also displayed a notable passion for motorcycles and racing. He devoted time at the Willow Springs Raceway in Rosamond, California, where he not only competed in supersport motorcycle racing but also dabbled in designing and riding “chopper” motorcycles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tom-Cruise-Upset.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>An Accident Caused A Massive On-Set Brawl Between Tom Cruise And This Actor</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>You may be surprised by who was THIS angry with Tom.</span><p>As the years progressed, Hathaway would find himself reconnecting with fans from his Atreyu days. He went on tour with WizardWorld Conventions and marked his presence at both the Chicago and Philadelphia shows in 2011. He also made an appearance at the Supanova Pop Culture Expo in Sydney, Australia in June 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilnq6Vp7KvsMinnmarpKS%2FunnAramesaViu7Ctx2afmqyYlsSixYynnJqqXZmyosDHZpicm5mZsq%2FA0mamp2WjmsFuuMifnKWnnpx6sa3Ip2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
