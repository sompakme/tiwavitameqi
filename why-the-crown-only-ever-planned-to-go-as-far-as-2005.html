Like, that’s the end of our journey: Peace is restored to the land, and they lived happily ever after.”</p><p>The Crown chronicles the life of Queen Elizabeth II from the 1940s. Since the Netflix drama debuted in 2016, writers have faced questions about just how close to the modern day royal family the show would get. Morgan eventually explained that he felt anything in the past couple of decades would remain off screen.</p><p>“I just think you get so much more interesting [with time],” Morgan told <a href=#>THR</a> in August 2020. “<a href=#><strong>Meghan [Markle]</strong> and <strong>[Prince] Harry</strong> </a>are in the middle of their journey, and I don’t know what their journey is or how it will end. One wishes some happiness, but I’m much more comfortable writing about things that happened at least 20 years ago. I sort of have in my head a 20-year rule. That is enough time and enough distance to really understand something, to understand its role, to understand its position, to understand its relevance.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He continued, “Often things that appear absolutely wildly important today are instantly forgotten, and other things have a habit of sticking around and proving to be historically very relevant and long-lasting. I don’t know where in the scheme of things <strong>Prince Andrew</strong> or indeed Meghan Markle or Harry will ever appear.”</p><p>While some thought that the September 2022 death of the monarch might change his perspective, the season was written long before her passing. Filming on the final season started days before Queen Elizabeth II died at age 96. Production <a href=#>briefly paused</a> in the wake of her death but resumed later that month.</p><p>Indeed, final season of The Crown — the second part of which will debut on December 14 — will end long before either the Queen’s death or when Prince Harry met Meghan Markle. However, the last episodes will depict the beginning of another love story: when <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong> (<strong>Ed McVey</strong>) met <strong>Kate Middleton</strong> (<strong>Meg Bellamy</strong>)</a>. The Prince and Princess of Wales met in 2001 at St Andrews University, which will be covered before The Crown’s series finale.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6hsV2ptaZ5wqumsKZdpLutxYyerZ6qXaW5orrNnptmrJ9itLB5wKxkn5miYq60eZFpZ25n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
