Tensions have been high the last few weeks, but there is something he has to say. He respects the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns, but he will defeat him at WrestleMania. Rhodes doesn’t want to talk about this other individual, he would rather do that to his face. Rhodes asks Kevin Owens to join him in the ring. Owens’ music eventually hits, and Owens stomps to the ring. Before Owens can speak, Rhodes says this conversation needs to involve someone else as well. Sami Zayn. Zayn walks to the ring and shakes hands with Rhodes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Rhodes says this he is going to peel back the curtain a bit. He has nothing but respect and admiration for Owens. Owens helped him get on his feet when he first left WWE. He can never repay Owens, but he is going to try now. They need to have THE conversation. Owens says he’s heard everything Zayn has had to say. Zayn says he hasn’t heard what Owens has to say. They have turned on each other many times over the years, but they always get back together. Zayn tells Owens to say what he’s got to say, punch him in the face, and do whatever he needs to so they can get past this.</p><h4 id=h-check-out-last-week-s-coverage-wwe-smackdown-results-3-10-23>Check out last week’s coverage:&nbsp;<a href=#>WWE SmackDown Results (3/10/23)</a></h4><p>Owens asks Rhodes if he’s got what he wants because he’s ready to leave. He isn’t interested. Rhodes retorts it’s not about what he wants. It’s about what’s right and what the WWE Universe wants. Zayn says they can do something remarkable. They can be the ones that bring down the ones. They don’t have to be friends, they just have to work together. Owens asks why he would want to do this with someone who doesn’t want to be his friend. He’s all set. Owens thanks Rhodes for trying. Owens walks away.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h4>Dominik Mysterio and Rhea Ripley vs. Zelina Vega and Santos Escobar</h4><p>After a distraction from Ripley, Dominik surprises Escobar with a dropkick. Ripley tags in and tries a boot, but Escobar catches her foot. Vega tags in and leaps over Escobar and flattens Ripley with a senton. Ripley rolls out of the ring. Escobar takes out Dominik with a dive. Vega wipes out Ripley with a springboard moonsault. After the break, Dominik is working over Escobar. Vega gets the tag and lands a flurry of offense. Vega sends Dominik flying with a ranna. Ripley sneaks up behind Vega and hits Riptide for the win.</p><p>Winners- Dominik Mysterio and Rhea Ripley</p><p>After the match, Dominik grabs a mic and says his father is nothing but a deadbeat. Rey Mysterio is shown walking into the arena on the ‘tron. After the break, Mysterio joins Dominik and Ripley in the ring. Dominik jokes that his father showed up tonight, but he never showed up for him before. Mysterio asks Ripley to leave to have a moment with his son. Dominik blames Mysterio for being a waste of a father. Mysterio cuts Dominik off before he’s about to call home a POS.</p><p>Mysterio says he knows he wasn’t there for Dominik all the time, but that doesn’t mean he loves him any less. Dominik is Mysterio’s world. Mysterio made sacrifices so Dominik could have a life he didn’t. Mysterio starts to cry as he asks Dominik to stand next to him on the stage when he is inducted into the hall of fame. It may be too late, but Mysterio’s worst regret is the person Dominik has become. If it were any other punk-ass kid challenged him, he would gladly accept. Since it’s Dominik, he won’t. It’s not worth it. Mysterio drops the mic and walks away.</p><h4>WWE SmackDown Results Continue On The Next Page!</h4><p class=post-nav-links>Pages: <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>1</span> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>2</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJuaGlwYmLEuLGMrKSam5uZvLi6jKucrK2cqcBuf4xqbmZqYw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
