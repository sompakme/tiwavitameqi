Going to haunted houses that people fill with props and screamers is always an option, but even creepier than that would be to visit the real location that a horror movie was actually filmed on! Our culture is obsessed with horror movies, rightfully so. Watching countless amounts of horror films makes us wonder, where are all of these shot?</p><p>Unfortunately, many horror movies, especially in recent times, are shot on sets built in studios and sound stages. Even horror movies like The Babadook are all shot on locations created specifically to look a certain way for the movie. Obviously, we aren’t mad at them, because that movie is great, but it’s unfortunate that we have little access to explore the place that the movie was filmed. Luckily, there are countless movies that still use actual houses to film in, or shoot on the&nbsp;set of spooky locations. While you may not actually be able to step inside of the houses, it’s still worth visiting the location to see the building in the flesh.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some places, you’ll see, are actually open to the public, or somewhere you can stay for a fee. So what better way to celebrate the season than to cozy up in a place where you watched people get murdered? Click through to see 15 places that horror movies were filmed where you can actually visit:</p><h2 id=15-plimoth-plantation-from-hocus-pocus><strong>15. Plimoth Plantation From Hocus Pocus</strong></h2><p>via grayline.com</p><p>So Hocus Pocus isn’t a horror movie, depending on how old you are or who you ask, but it is definitely a Halloween essential. The film had a ton of different locations, but one that you can for sure visit is the Plimoth Planation in Massachusetts. This location was used for the opening scenes for Thackeray’s (the cat) village. This plantation is actually open to the public and can be visited during normal business hours. Hocus Pocus isn’t the only movie that was filmed here either. The Crucible and Warlock both have scenes that take place here as well. If you do ever get the chance to visit the plantation, you can also check out the other locations from Hocus Pocus. Much of the rest of the film was shot in locations around Salem, including their house and the high school. While it may not be the spookiest place to visit, it’s definitely good to check out on Halloween night!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-buffalo-bill-s-house-from-silence-of-the-lambs><strong>14. Buffalo Bill's House From Silence Of The Lambs</strong></h2><p>via nbcnews.com</p><p>Who doesn’t remember the iconic house of Buffalo Bill from the amazing horror movie, Silence of the Lambs. If you’ve seen the movie, you know how important both the interior and exterior shots of the house are. The basement is complicated and spooky, and no doubt is there a history of creepiness to the house. The house actually went up for sale earlier this year with a listing for $300,000. The owners of the house actually had a pretty difficult time selling the home located just south of Pittsburgh. The price dropped to $249,000, not bad for a large house with lots of history. But some people turn away once they realize the gruesome history of the house. Would you be willing to live in a place where Buffalo Bill tortured his victims, in a fictional world, that is?</p><h2 id=13-the-house-from-poltergeist><strong>13. The House From Poltergeist</strong></h2><p>via movielocationsandmore.blogspot.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Poltergeist house is definitely one of the creepiest locations for horror movies. The premise of the movie was about how the house was haunted by Poltergeists after being built on a graveyard. After the movie, there were supposed curses that followed the cast, some saying it was because they used real skeletons to shoot, as they were easier to purchase than prop skeletons. The house is now currently privately owned, so you can’t take a tour in the house. The interior has been renovated as well, like most houses that were built in the 80s, so it would bring back much nostalgia anyways. But the exterior is definitely still very similar, and that sits on a residential street, somewhere perfectly legal for you to take a quick drive and snap a couple pictures. And who knows, perhaps it will go for sale soon just like the Buffalo Bill house!</p><h2 id=12-the-mall-from-chopping-mall><strong>12. The Mall From Chopping Mall</strong></h2><p>via planetneukoln.biserika.ro</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chopping Mall is an awesome 80s horror movie that revolves around a group of teens that get terrorized by robots. The robots come out after the mall closes in order to patrol the area and kill any criminal on sight. They work fine until the night that a group of teens decide to party in a furniture store. The robots go a little crazy and attack the teens. The entire movie takes place inside the mall, which gets pretty destroyed throughout the film. The movie was mostly filmed inside the mall, with just a few shots in different sets. The mall is the Sherman Oaks Galleria located in Los Angeles California. The mall has seen some definite makeovers since the shooting took place, but the fact that we can still visit the mall where it all took place is pretty cool. Luckily the robots won’t be there this time.</p><h2 id=11-the-steps-from-the-exorcist><strong>11. The Steps From The Exorcist</strong></h2><p>via youtube.com</p><p>The Exorcist will always be known as one of the greatest movies of all time. Most of the movie takes place inside the home of Regan, the little girl who is possessed, though there are locations that are open to the public to visit. The house that it was shot in still exists, though some scenes took place elsewhere and were made to look like they were in the house. But one place that is very real and very open to the public are the stairs in which Father Karras falls to his death. The stairs are located in Georgetown, Washington D.C., and are recognized as a national D.C. landmark. That’s pretty strange, considering that most of the D.C. landmarks are historical locations important for their political influences. But fans can still check out the stairs and see for themselves just how far Father Karras fell.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-the-lighthouse-from-the-ring><strong>10. The Lighthouse From The Ring</strong></h2><p>via tumblr.com</p><p>The Ring is a recent horror movie on the list known for creeping us out with the use of VHS tapes. Ever since the movie came out, we’ve all feared wells, mysterious media, and little girls with long black hair. If you’re brave enough, you can actually visit a spot from the set of the movie. The film took place in a ton of locations compared to some movies on the list that only existed in a few locations. The houses that the movie was filmed in still exist, even the creepy cabin in the woods. These are all privately owned, however, and not just anyone can walk up to them. That’s not the case for the lighthouse that was featured in the movie. Though you can’t go inside, you can still visit the location and the shore and think about all the creepy stuff that took place there in the world of the movie.</p><h2 id=9-the-apartments-from-rosemary-s-baby><strong>9. The Apartments From Rosemary's Baby</strong></h2><p>via blogspot.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you’ve seen Rosemary’s Baby, if you’re anything like me at least, then you’d move into the apartment building the film took place in without a doubt, even with the risk of having neighbors who worship Satan. The huge apartment featured awesome built-ins, gorgeous views, and a vintage aesthetic. The apartments that were in the movie were actually real New York City apartments! The apartments have been the home of many famous people, including Judy Garland. The Dakota Apartments are even on the same block where <a href=#>John Lennon </a>was fatally gunned down. Unfortunately, these apartments are not open to the public. Since they’re located right across from Central Park, you can imagine these apartments only go to the wealthiest of residents who probably have little to no interest in living in a tourist spot. But you can still definitely visit the exterior and take pictures where the resident before Rosemary took a fatal jump!</p><h2 id=8-the-house-from-halloween><strong>8. The House From Halloween</strong></h2><p>via mapio.net</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Halloween is the ultimate Halloween horror movie. Who isn’t terrified of the face of Michael Myers? What was once the spooky location of his house is much different now. The film took place in many different locations. Some are open to the public, as some of the movie took place simply on the streets. However, the rest of the houses in which the movie were filmed are closed off to the public, as they are residential homes. There is one way you can sneak into the old house of Michael Myers, however: a chiropractic appointment. That’s right, what was once the childhood home of Michael Myers has become the office building of a chiropractor! The house was even moved from one side of the street to the next! It even got a fresh coat of paint as well, so it’s not as recognizable as the run down version in the movie.</p><h2 id=7-the-town-from-the-blair-witch><strong>7. The Town From The Blair Witch</strong></h2><p>via thedissolve.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The set of The Blair Witch is probably one of the easiest locations to visit, as it all took place outside. The entire film was shot in the woods of Burkittsville, Maryland. The town is extremely small with a population of less than 200 people. After the filming of the movie, the small and quiet town found itself overrun with people looking through the woods trying to find all the locations of the movie. If you’d like, you can visit yourself. Unfortunately, many state that there isn’t much to find. But with the new movie out, perhaps there is a chance that the Blair Witch has been awakened and is waiting for new visitors. The scariest thing you’d probably find are angry small town people who loathe the movie that disturbed their peaceful community. Still worth checking out though, who knows what you might find.</p><h2 id=6-the-amityville-horror-house><strong>6. The Amityville Horror House</strong></h2><p>via pinterest.com</p><p>When you have a movie about a haunted house, the desire to visit that house becomes extremely urgent. That’s especially the case for The Amityville Horror, which was a movie based on a real-life story of a family who was brutally murdered. The people who moved in after the murders were then terrorized by ghosts. There have been countless movies based&nbsp;on the story, but the one that did it best was the original 1979 horror movie. None of the movies were filmed in the actual home, however, many sets were recreated to look like the original appearance of the spooky house. If you’re going to visit anywhere involving the actual movie, the house where the real murders took place is the way to go. Just like the Silence of the Lambs house, this house went on sale earlier this year. The price was a little less than a million dollars, a small price to pay for a historical New York home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-the-houses-from-a-nightmare-on-elm-street><strong>5. The Houses From A Nightmare On Elm Street</strong></h2><p>via horror.wikia.com</p><p>A Nightmare On Elm Street is another classic on the list that made it hard for us to fall asleep. The movie took place in several locations, but the one that sticks out the most were the homes of Nancy and Glen. Both of the houses were actual houses, though some of the interior shots were filmed on a soundstage. But the exteriors were real, and the two homes do actually sit right across from each other just like in the movie. The homes aren’t open to the public, as they have undergone a ton of expensive renovations that the homeowners probably don’t want to mess up. but like many homes in Los Angeles, you can still drive by and snap pictures. Although, we don’t blame you if you have no interest in visiting the site where a young <a href=#>Johnny Depp</a> was murdered in his bed blender style.</p><h2 id=4-the-camp-from-friday-the-13th><strong>4. The Camp From Friday The 13th</strong></h2><p>via youtube.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What better place to spend the Halloween season than in the spooky woods? What about the spooky camp in which all the murders from the movie, Friday the 13th, took place? Well you could definitely visit the location if you’d like, as it’s still a real place. The only requirement? You must be a boy scout of America. That’s right, this once spooky campsite in which the movie was filmed is now a camp for boy scouts. You can’t visit the camp itself unless you are an actual camper part of the troop, but you can still drive by as well as the surrounding areas where other shots took place. Forr&nbsp;most of us, we won’t get the chance to take a peek at the spooky forest, but perhaps they’ll open it to the public again one day.</p><h2 id=3-the-hotel-from-the-shining><strong>3. The Hotel From The Shining</strong></h2><p>via paranormalresearchsociety.org</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Shining is a movie known for its incredible location. The hotel in which it takes place has a certain elegance to it that’s still capable of spooking us to our core. The hotel that the book and film are inspired by is an actual hotel that you can stay in! Stephen King stayed in the Stanley Hotel one night with his wife when he got the inspiration for the story. The actual hotel in the movie, however, is merely a very large set that was somewhat inspired by the interiors of the Stanley Hotel. The exterior shots were supplied by the Timberline Lodge in Oregon, however. If you are able, both locations deserve a visit! <a href=#>Stephen King</a> stated that when he visited The Stanley Hotel with his wife before writing the book, the hotel was about to close for the season, causing it to be almost completely empty. Perhaps booking a room during a slow period would be the perfect way to enjoy the charm.</p><h2 id=2-the-real-haunted-house-from-the-conjuring><strong>2. The Real Haunted House From The Conjuring</strong></h2><p>via youtube.com</p><p>The Conjuring is another movie on the list that was inspired by true events. The film was actually mostly shot inside a studio, with a few exterior shots in various locations. However, they did a great job of replicating the house in the movie, as it’s almost identical to the real thing. The house was reportedly haunted and the real Ed and Lorraine did visit the home to rid the house of spirits. The actual current owners of the home were surprisingly upset over the film. They stated that they have numerous people call them wanting to tear or burn down the house since it was so full of evil spirits. If you’re desperately curious, the best route would be to just visit the exterior and wonder what really occurred inside. No threatening phone calls necessary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-oakley-court-hotel-from-multiple-films><strong>1. Oakley Court Hotel From Multiple Films</strong></h2><p>via the-oakley-court-windsor.booked.net</p><p>The Oakley Court Hotel was originally built for the High Sheriff of Berkshire in 1859. Due to its gorgeous appearance, it has become a popular film spot for many movies. The location was home to the British Film Production company, Hammer Films. The interior and exterior were used to shoot The Man In Black and The Lady Craved Excitement. It then became a popular site for mostly exterior shots and can be seen in movies like The Brides of Dracula, The Reptile, and The Plague of the Zombies. But the most famous, specifically horror, movies of all that were shot there are Vampyres and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The hotel is open to whomever, although that’s not the easiest of tasks. If you ever find yourself in Berkshire, however, you must check out the gorgeous exteriors of the hotel.</p><p><strong>Sources</strong>: IMDB.com, wikipedia.org</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKCfmLiqusZoaG5lk6eyprzInqqtZZikv7O70WakqK6Zmnqtu8Kaq6Knnqh6urvUZpqapl2WsLXBwKWjsmWmnsCqwI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
