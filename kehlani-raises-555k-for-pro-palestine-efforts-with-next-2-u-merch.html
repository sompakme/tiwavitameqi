No one got us the way we got each other. Me & my team feel overwhelmed with gratitude for y’all showing out for this fundraiser.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As the post continued, the musicians resumed showering Palestinians with love and reassured their fans that they can do great things when united in the face of social anxieties and evils. The artists concluded their message by <a href=#>asserting that Palestine “will win” </a>with the help of their support.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We’re blessed to say we supported artists in the West Bank while raising money for families in Gaza, Sudan, and Congo. We’re blessed to say that we are supported by a community standing on business together. We’re blessed to play a small part in a growing tide towards the truth about Palestine,” they added.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We’re invincible together and I feel ever so inspired by yall. THANK you for showing out on the streets of DC, with your dollars, with your labor and [organizing], with your bodies blocking business as usual THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. I believe that we will win.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In May, Kehlani went off on a rant aimed at their music industry peers for not doing enough to support those hurting and dying from the atrocities committed during the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Oakland native called them out for their “silence” on the Middle East “genocide” and admitted that they couldn’t get rid of this “rage” that was bubbling up inside of them.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Kehlani explained that they were done “begging” their peers for assistance on the matter and would do everything in their power to be on the right side of history—even if it meant removing these people from their lives. “It’s f**k Israel, f**k Zionism, and f**k a lot of y’all, too,” they staunchly proclaimed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch the video above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6CyqbjAp6BmqpGewKa%2FjG5sbqNdpb%2Bwec%2Bao56rpJ67pnnNnq%2BtZWJiwm65xKuaoWVhZ4B1hJdvaWxoXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
