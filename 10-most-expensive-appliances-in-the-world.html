That grill for your backyard? That coffee maker for your workroom?</p><p>If you want any of these high-end appliances or fixtures be sure to set aside a small fortune. Make that a big fortune. Or maybe part of your life savings. These are, after all, the most expensive appliances in the world.</p><h2 id=10-the-thermomix-food-processor-1-400><b>10. The Thermomix food processor – $1,400</b></h2><p>The Thermomix can do many things to your food; it can chop it, beat it, emulsify it, mill it, knead it, blend, it, cook it, melt it and steam it. It can even weigh it. This food processor can reportedly whip up a carrot cake mixture in 30 seconds, a Crème Brulee in 15 minutes and Hollandaise sauce in four minutes. U.S. residents who want to order this appliance may be disappointed to find out it is not for sale in the U.S. However, it is available for purchase via Thermomix Canada.</p><h2 id=9-hobart-n50-mixer-2-223><b>9. Hobart N50 mixer – $2,223</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Run it like someone is chasing it” the description on their official website reads. The N50 five-quart mixer has the 1/6 horsepower Hobart speed motor, you can choose between three speeds to suit your needs and the controls are easy to locate and operate. The mixer is designed to be stable during operations and easy enough to clean after. The bowl is big enough for how much you need to mix of anything.

With just a flick of a finger you can choose between a macchiato, café latte, cappuccino or an espresso and it will be ready in 15 seconds, 45 seconds if it’s coming from complete standby. The Scanomat TopBrewer has the appearance of a table with a spout on top so it can be inconspicuous anywhere. The processing takes place under the covers and no noise or smell escapes from the drawer. This is another product not yet widely available in the U.S. and has to be ordered from Denmark, but a woman who was able to purchase one in the U.S. reportedly did so for $16,000<i>.</i></p><h2 id=6-the-kalamazoo-900-series-freestanding-hybrid-grill-with-side-burner-15-895><b>6. The Kalamazoo 900 Series FreeStanding Hybrid Grill with Side Burner – $15,895</b></h2><p>While many barbecues enthusiasts out there are arguing as to whether gas or charcoal is best for the grill, users of the Kalamazoo 900 are spared that problem. This hybrid grill can cook with whatever fuel is available, wood, charcoal or gas. The big, customize-able space on the grill allows for cooking even the biggest of choice parts and the deep drip tray makes for easy cleaning. This hybrid grill powers up at 144,000 BTU's reportedly enough to heat a small house.

The Velocity HP1000 tanning bed – $33,999</b></h2><p>This tanning bed by ETS Tan does not look like the usual tanning bed, more like a hammock that tans from above and bellow, allowing the user to cook yet not get cut off from the rest of the world. The bed has its own entertainment system with a subwoofer stereo and a four-speaker system comprising of four inputs that includes one for your iPod. The device also has a failsafe that prevents users from getting burned during fast tanning and a system to cool down body temperature.</p><h2 id=3-the-meneghini-la-cambusa-refrigerator-41-500><b>3.

It is all a refrigerator, oven, microwave, freezer, pantry and coffee-maker in one. Some models even have a flatscreen TV. The right-side door is designed for the usual refrigerator items like milk, fruits and water bottles. The left-side door is for anything else that cannot fit in the right-side door, like a tall bottle of wine or two crates of beer. The middle door is where the coffeemaker, the microwave and the TV are. When all its doors are closed, the La Cambusa appears like an antique cabinet, making it great for any room in the house.</p><h2 id=2-la-cornue-grand-palais-range-50-000><b>2. La Cornue Grand Palais Range – $50,000</b></h2><p>The famous Le Cordon Bleu School in Paris only uses this range and no other.

The range also comes with a solid stainless steel counter top and two vaulted ovens with airtight, seamless doors. They are finished in porcelain enamel and are available in 16 colors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-electrolux-grand-cuisine-range-103-000><b>1.

Buyer can also choose to have their ranges specified by color and choose between an electric solid top, a gas solid top, a hot cupboard, a fryer, a fry top, hot surface, induction, a gas burner and a gas or an electric static oven.<i></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e5BpZKano6l6psTPnqWsoaaaeqK8z6WgmqaTmsButc1mq6GdXay8s7jDaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
