Henson</a>, and <a href=# id=auto-tag_h-e-r data-tag=h-e-r>H.E.R.</a>—gracing the cover. In the conversation among the women, they spoke on the film’s legacy, its representation of sisterhood, and paid tribute to the women from the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234655973>1985 Oscar-nominated film.</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Oprah was the one who posed the question for everyone else to give their on-screen predecessors their flowers. “This has <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234738592>a legacy</a>—the book Alice Walker wrote [in 1982], then our film version in 1985, then the musical in 2005 and again in 2015. And now here we are,” she began.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“If given the opportunity, what would you say to the women who played your characters in the original 1985 cast of&nbsp;The Color Purple?,” Winfrey asked.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Fantasia answered, “I would say thank you, Ms. Whoopi Goldberg, for not being afraid to <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234646948>play Celie</a>. For being honest. Thank you for paving the way for girls like myself.” The “Truth Is” singer almost declined the role when asked because “I knew I was going to have to step into some things that I’d buried,” but thankfully, she faced her battles head-on and was <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234769682>well-supported</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Henson, who plays Shug Avery, thanked Margaret Avery. “You taught me how to be sexy and how to see myself as a fully realized sexy woman,” said the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=669013>Hidden Figures</a> actress. “This industry can do a job on you and give you some insecurities. And when I found Ms. Shug Avery, she just made me feel like a woman. I was the one who always covered up. I didn’t feel right in my body. So to see this beautiful Black woman on the screen made me feel seen.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Avery took on the role after Tina Turner <a href=#>turned down roles</a> as both Celie and Shug because it felt too similar to her life with Ike Turner.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">H.E.R. thanked Rae Dawn Chong, who played Squeak, for “giving me an opportunity to show myself. A lot of people know me and my music, but they don’t really know me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Meanwhile, the person Brooks was set to thank was right next to her.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I don’t know if I can do this without crying, because this is special,” said the <a href=#>Orange Is The New Black</a> star. Oprah affectionately called her, “Baby girl,” before Brooks continued.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I just want to thank you, Ms. Oprah, for surrendering to God and his plan for your life. You have shown me how to do that. Thank you for laying the blueprint for Sofia—because I know that she’s changed your life, and I can feel that mine is about to shift, too. Thank you for leaving space for me but also being there, to hold my hand and answer that phone call when I needed you. You have been such a light, such a beautiful soul,” she stated.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Oprah’s first feature film role was as Sofia in the 1985 Steven Spielberg-directed film and she only earned $35,000 for it. She considered the musical remake to be a “full circle moment.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">For those questioning Halle Bailey’s absence, the shoot and subsequent conversation took place back in May during her<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234741928> Little Mermaid</a> promotional run.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Color Purple (2023) is a big-screen adaptation of the Tony Award-nominated Broadway musical, not a remake of the original book-to-film adaptation. It <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234653120>stars</a> Fantasia as Celie, Brooks as Sofia, Henson as Shug, H.E.R. as Squeak, Bailey as Young Nettie, Colman Domingo as Mister, and Corey Hawkins as Harpo.
