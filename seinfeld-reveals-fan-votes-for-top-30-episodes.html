Simply put, it was always great television when Jerry, Kramer, Elaine and George appeared together in Seinfeld's apartment. There was never a dull moment with these two.</p><p>The official Seinfeld TV Instagram account asked fans to vote for the top episodes, and the results have been published. You can view the top 30 here below, with "The Contest" (the 11th episode from season four) claiming the top spot.</p><p>The Instagram account&nbsp;has began the countdown part, displaying clips from each of the episodes. Assuming they keep the trend going, we'll see a part of "The Limo" on the Instagram page Wednesday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The Contest" has been widely mentioned in other films and TV series - including Curb Your Enthusiasm and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.&nbsp;Not only that, but there were plenty of references from the&nbsp;episode&nbsp;in Seinfeld as the show progressed.</p><p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Alexander Explains Why There Won't Be A "Seinfeld" Reboot</a></strong></p><p>via: bustle.com</p><p>The top 15 here are dominated by episodes that revolve around George Costanza, portrayed by Jason Alexander. This includes "The Marine Biologist,", "The Opposite", "The Hamptons", "The Rye" and "The Strike."</p><p>But really, at the end of the day, you can argue that just about every episode (minus the clip montage episodes) are worthy of the No. 1 spot. There were so many timeless moments throughout the series, after all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As you'll see here, "The Finale," (a two-part episode) did not make the top 30. It aired on May 14, 1998, and the show's final episode received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Larry David, who co-wrote the show with Seinfeld, even made a comeback to help write the finale. As it turns out, the majority of voters weren't pleased enough with the show's conclusion to put it in the top 30.</p><p><strong>Next: <a href=#>Plastic Bags Were Originally Created To Save The Planet, Not Hurt It</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrZ2cmsOqv8iopWirlZ67p7HLnWStp6BigHF5xKmgrKeUmsBuws6tnJ1lkq56p63NrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
