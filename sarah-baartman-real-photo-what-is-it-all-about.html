Her real photo has now been circulating on the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Rumors regarding a potential Hollywood biopic of Baartman’s life have raised concerns.</p><p>One of the first black women to be implicated in human s*x trafficking was Sarah Baartman. She was mockingly dubbed the “<strong>Hottentot Venus</strong>” by Europeans because, during her short life, her body was cruelly exposed and subjected to public scrutiny.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, her experience confirmed the Europeans’ incredibly harmful s*xual obsession with the bodies of African women.</p><p>She was reportedly brought to Europe under false pretenses by a British doctor.&nbsp;</p><p>Dubbed the “<strong>Hottentot Venus</strong>,” she has performed at freak exhibitions in London and Paris, where the public was allowed to gawk at her enormous buttocks.</p><p>She is now widely seen as the poster child for racism, colonial exploitation, and the denigration and commodification of black people.</p><p>Beyonce’s agents refuted rumors that she intended to create and feature in a movie about Baartman.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Beyonce</a> was criticized for lacking <strong>‘the essential human decency to be capable of authoring Sarah’s story, let alone acting the part,’</strong> according to Jean Burgess, a chief from the Khoikhoi tribe that Baartman belonged to.</p><p>Due to her wide hips and unusual body coloring, Sara Baartman attracted the attention of colonial Europeans who believed they were racially superior.</p><p>Dunlop desired Sara to relocate to London and turn into a showpiece.&nbsp;</p><p>She was eventually transported to London, where she was shown in a building on Piccadilly, a street known for having the plus ultra of hideousness and the biggest deformity in the world, among other curiosities.</p><p>Sara’s half-naked body was placed in a cage that was about a meter and a half high for white men and women to pay to view. She attracted individuals from many regions of Europe.</p><p>Although Sarah Baartman passed away on December 29, 1815, her show continued.</p><p>Her skeleton, reproductive organs, and brain were displayed in a Parisian museum until 1974. In 2002, her bones were finally returned and interred.</p><p>Even though denying any connection to a movie, Beyonce’s agent stated: <strong>‘This is a narrative that needs to be told.’</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who was Sara Baartman?</strong></h2><p>The Eastern Cape, now known as the Gamtoos river, is where Sara “<strong>Saartjie</strong>” Baartman was born in 1789.&nbsp;</p><p>She belonged to the Khoikhoi Gonaquasub tribe, which tended cattle. Little Sara was raised as a servant on a farm in the colonial era.</p><p>Her mother passed away when she was just two years old, and her father, a cattle driver, passed away while she was growing up.&nbsp;</p><p>Sara also wed a Khoikhoi drummer who was a member of her clan, and the two had a child together. Sadly, their newborn child passed away quickly.</p><p>Sara’s spouse was killed by Dutch colonists when she was sixteen years old. She was later sold into slavery by a trader named Pieter Willem Cezar, who took her to Cape Town and employed her as his brother’s housekeeper.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2FwKuYoWWSlq6zwMyapWaqlZa5brzHqKuoZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
