Throughout his time in both NXT and on the main roster, Wyatt's trademark has been his ability to deliver promos that can range from silly to threatening and they always have an eerie mystique about them. Wyatt has had many standout promos throughout the years and has made a living coming up with dark new phrases to stick in the minds of the fans. Let's look at 10 of his creepiest quotes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Eddie Kingston's 10 Best Promo Quotes In AEW</a></span></p><h3 id=update-2023-08-25-14-40-est-by-ethan-schlabaugh>UPDATE: 2023/08/25 14:40 EST BY ETHAN SCHLABAUGH</h3><p>Bray Wyatt was one of the darkest and most fearful wrestlers to come around since the 90s and could grab the attention of an audience with the way he spoke. Wyatt wasn't a typical wrestler who shouted to get the crowd hyped up but instead quietly and softly spoke into the mic and made fans listen closely. The many different characters that he played ranging from the spooky cult-like leader to the loving and cheerful kid's show host, Bray Wyatt never failed to capture the WWE Universe. Out of respect to a man who was taken away far too soon, here are some of the creepiest and best quotes that came from the Bray Wyatt character. Rest in peace, Windham Rotunda</p><h2 id=ldquo-i-didn-rsquo-t-make-the-world-the-way-it-is-hellip-you-did-rdquo><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>“I Didn’t Make The World The Way It Is… You Did”</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bray-Wyatt-interview-by-Michael-Cole-Cropped.jpg><p>This quote from an interview alongside Michael Cole has recently been brought back to light, <a href=#>as Bray Wyatt’s recent return campaign</a> seemed to reference this old interview of his. During it, he states “I didn’t make the world the way it is… you did”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The “you” in this case feels plural, but it also feels like Wyatt is saying that whatever he does should bear no blame onto him, but rather the ones who created the world we live in. In 2022, a similar quote, “Who killed the world? You did”, made the rounds in the "White Rabbit" teasers, with this adding more depth to Wyatt’s previous words.</p><h2 id=quot-beware-the-man-in-the-woods-quot><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>"Beware The Man In The Woods"</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/fiend-feature.jpg><p>WWE uploaded a YouTube video called Superstar Ghost Stories and one episode featured Bray Wyatt talking about the man in the woods. The story would depict this monster as something that made howls and had pale white skin, and long yellow hair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The episode came out on October 31st, 2015 long before the debut of The Fiend on television. <a href=#>Fans noticed from the video that the description of the man in the woods matched The Fiend's</a>. The ending saw Bray reveal that Sister Abigail told him that he was actually the man in the woods.</p><h2 id=ldquo-i-rsquo-m-just-a-servant-i-rsquo-ll-go-where-the-circle-takes-me-rdquo><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>“I’m Just A Servant, I’ll Go Where The Circle Takes Me”</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bray-Wyatt---Promo---Smackdown.jfif><p>On the topic of Bray Wyatt’s recent return, <a href=#>he seems to be involved in a battle within himself.</a> For the first time in WWE, it felt as though Wyatt was playing with the idea of being much more grounded and pure, but he was being pulled away by evil.</p><p>Wyatt explained he was just a servant, and that he will go where the circle took him. What the circle is, is uncertain, but these words indicate that he is acting as a tool or a vessel, just taking commands from the evil inside of him, making him feel so much more dangerous and unpredictable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ldquo-i-will-build-my-empire-next-to-the-sea-so-i-can-laugh-from-my-throne-as-my-enemies-drown-rdquo><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>“I Will Build My Empire Next To The Sea, So I Can Laugh From My Throne As My Enemies Drown”</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Wyatt-Family-vs-The-Shield.jpg><p><a href=#>During The Wyatt Family’s feud with The Shield,</a> Wyatt came out with this statement, which heavily implies that he enjoys seeing his enemies suffer.</p><p>At the time, this further added to the sinister side of Wyatt, who was made to feel unforgiving in his search for further power. The part regarding an empire adds to that also.</p><h2 id=quot-yowie-wowie-quot><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>"Yowie Wowie"</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-Fiend-as-the-Universal-Champion.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not exactly the most threatening phrase in anyone's playbook, but Wyatt's Fiend persona has turned that from a seemingly odd one-off line into a dark calling card for his more stable persona.</p><p><a href=#>Wyatt coined the phrase in the first-ever Firefly Funhouse</a> segment in 2019 and fans have since latched onto the odd nonsense phrase, even chanting it at Wyatt during his matches. The juxtaposition of the silly words with the intimidating look of The Fiend presents what is both alluring and repelling about the Bray Wyatt character all in one.</p><h2 id=quot-i-am-going-to-take-pleasure-in-watching-you-burn-man-quot><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>"I Am Going To Take Pleasure In Watching You Burn Man"</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bray-wyatt-fcw-promo.jpg><p>Before he made his way to the main roster and fully developed the Bray Wyatt character, the origins started down in Florida Championship Wrestling. Wyatt started off by cutting a few promos before stepping in the ring and having his debut match.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In one of his first promos, he talks about how he fears for whoever it is that will be the first man to step in the ring with him. During this, he claims that he is going to take pleasure in watching his opponent burn just like his father who he said burned on his shrimp boat.</p><h2 id=quot-he-39-s-got-the-whole-world-in-his-hands-quot><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>"He's Got The Whole World In His Hands"</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bray-Wyatt-as-WWE-Champion-Cropped.jpg><p>Wyatt has always been adept at taking seemingly innocent things and twisting them to become more menacing, be it children's puppets or seemingly innocuous songs like this one.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Miz & 9 Other Wrestlers You Forgot Bray Wyatt Feuded With</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wyatt began to use this as a rallying cry, one which was quickly adopted by fans as a chant to go alongside holding up their phones as Bray's "fireflies." The unsettling, swaying manner in which Wyatt intoned the song has stuck with fans for years and became a symbol of his ability to control the minds of people through his voice.</p><h2 id=quot-i-confess-that-along-this-journey-i-am-going-to-do-horrible-horrible-things-quot><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>"I Confess That Along This Journey I Am Going To Do Horrible, Horrible Things"</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bray-wyatt-promo-cropped-1.jpg><p>In the same promo mentioned earlier where Bray talks about going wherever the circle takes him, he also mentions what is coming up and what he is going to do in the future.</p><p>Wyatt says that he has to confess a few things to everyone. One of them is that he is going to do some horrible things and that he will never feel sorry for what that is. The weeks after this promo, Wyatt would have a few in-ring altercations with LA Knight leading to their Royal Rumble match.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=quot-the-first-time-that-i-ever-looked-inside-of-your-eyes-i-knew-that-you-were-evil-quot><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>"The First Time That I Ever Looked Inside Of Your Eyes...I Knew That You Were Evil"</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Wyatt-Family-Cropped.jpg><p>On the May 19th, 2014 episode of Monday Night Raw after beating John Cena two weeks prior at the Extreme Rules event, Wyatt would deliver a promo about his childhood and a teacher that he once had who looked down on him and made sure he knew that he was filth and worthless.</p><p>Wyatt mentioned a quote from that teacher where she mentions that the first time she ever looked at him, she knew he was an evil person. He then touted the fact that the teacher is now an old woman in a retirement home rotting away while he stands before the crowd as a conqueror and revolutionary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=quot-i-have-been-the-answer-all-along-quot><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>"I...Have Been The Answer All Along"</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bray-Wyatt-Sitting-Down-Cropped.jpg><p>Something that has marked Wyatt's character since its inception is his god complex, the feeling that he is the savior of the WWE Universe. In his debut promo on Raw, Wyatt hyped his character with big talk about how "the man who made [the fans] was a liar" and established himself as a would-be messiah with poetic yet demonic words to share with the world.</p><p>Wyatt has always been opposed to the forces that would keep him from taking power and this line illustrates how highly he has always thought of himself.</p><h2 id=quot-be-careful-inviting-the-devil-into-your-backyard-because-he-may-just-like-it-quot><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>"Be Careful Inviting The Devil Into Your Backyard Because He May Just Like It"</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bray-Wyatt-promo-in-the-steel-cage-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wyatt's character has always been identified as devilish and a proprietor of evil, which is exemplified in this quote. Wyatt told this to The Shield after interfering in one of their matches and en route to a collision at Elimination Chamber 2014, in an attempt to intimidate them.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Bray Wyatt Vs John Cena: 10 Things Fans Forget About Their WWE Rivalry </a></span>Wyatt's quote belies the nature that has been consistent for his character, even when changing from a backwoods messiah to a demonic clown reminiscent of Pennywise. Once he is invited into someone's presence, he will take everything from them like the devil takes a soul.</p><h2 id=quot-i-love-you-sister-abigail-quot><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>"I Love You, Sister Abigail"</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Bray-Wyatt-As-Sister-Abigail-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The mythology of Wyatt's character has always been one of interest to fans, perhaps nothing in it more so than the character of Sister Abigail. In his background, Abigail was a leader to a young Wyatt who told him he was destined to be a sort of chosen one to all people.</p><p>Wyatt became obsessed with her after she burned to death (as he mentions in this very promo) and he has channeled her spirit in the past with his devotion seemingly being a pathway to his more mythical powers.</p><h2 id=quot-follow-the-buzzards-quot><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>"Follow The Buzzards"</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Bray-Wyatt-WWE-Promo.jpg><p><a href=#>In the early days of the Wyatt Family, Bray would punctuate his promos </a>or any big segments in the ring by dropping to his knees and screaming this phrase. Its meaning is that if anyone is looking to find or follow Wyatt, all one must do is follow the buzzards circling the bodies he leaves in his wake.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This simple yet cryptic sentence is rife with imagery that admits to the monstrous characteristics of Wyatt and was one of his most lasting catchphrases for a long time, indicative of his advanced promo style.</p><h2 id=quot-i-am-the-color-red-in-a-world-full-of-black-and-white-quot><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>"I Am The Color Red In A World Full Of Black And White"</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Bray-Wyatt-v-John-Cena-WrestleMania-30-Cropped.jpg><p><a href=#>During his feud with John Cena</a>, Wyatt attacked the idea of Cena's legacy in the WWE and looked to make a name for himself off the back of one of WWE's living legends. In this quote, Wyatt exemplifies what makes him different, not just from Cena but from practically any professional wrestler altogether, as someone wholly different from what you may see in any corner of it.</p><p>For the past decade, Wyatt has proven that he represents a creative risk taken by WWE, something that is sadly too rare as of late.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=quot-i-will-take-my-rightful-place-among-the-gods-as-the-new-face-of-fear-quot><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>"I Will Take My Rightful Place Among The Gods As The New Face Of Fear"</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bray-Wyatt-promo-to-Undertaker-Cropped.jpg><p>It was inevitable that Bray Wyatt would lock horns with one of WWE's most revered and spookiest characters, The Undertaker. In deeming himself the new face of fear, Wyatt looked to establish that he would become what Undertaker had been for decades prior: a gateway for WWE to dabble in the mystical and fantastique and a force to scare the young and old alike.</p><p><a href=#>Although Wyatt would not do this by defeating The Undertaker</a> at WrestleMania (or at Survivor Series that year), his activity as The Fiend has made that case strong.</p><h2 id=quot-walk-with-the-reapers-burn-with-the-saints-quot><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>"...Walk With The Reapers...Burn With The Saints."</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-Wyatt-Family.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Daniel Bryan and Bray Wyatt have found themselves at odds</a> several times throughout their careers, with Bryan even joining the Wyatt Family briefly before turning on them. This development did not shake Wyatt, as he promised to make Bryan "burn" for turning on him, a decision he took instead of choosing to walk with the "reapers" in his family.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Bray Wyatt & Matt Hardy: 10 Things Fans Forget About Their WWE Rivalry & Tag Team</a></span></p><p>This line is Wyatt's most complex and is a startling turn of phrase for a wrestler, which only serves to differentiate Wyatt further as an intimidating yet eloquent performer in WWE.</p><h2 id=quot-let-me-in-quot><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>"Let Me In"</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bray-Wyatt-Firefly-Funhouse-WWE.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The calling card of The Fiend has become Wyatt's most chilling line to date, due to both how short and how cutting it is. The Fiend character is one meant to bring down one's defenses through silly devices like the Firefly Funhouse while also worming his way inside the mind of anyone who watches and, once someone lets Wyatt in, he will surely take their soul.</p><p>Those three words represent the threat of The Fiend that lies within a tantalizing invitation and sums up why everyone in WWE should fear him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenp7K0wMuipaBnkqeuunnWspitrF2btrOxzZ1knKqVmr26edOeqauhlq62r7OMpaCnnaNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
