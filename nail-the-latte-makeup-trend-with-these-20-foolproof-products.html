The latest food-centric makeup trend is fall’s It-girl look (look to <strong>Hailey Bieber</strong> and <strong>Zendaya</strong> for inspo), and it’s easily emulated. Inspired by a latte’s rich brown hue, the craze requires minimal effort — just a bit of bronzer, a beige smokey eye or a nude lip is all it takes to create the vibe and make it your own.</p><p>Not sure where to start? Don’t worry. We compiled the top products to help you accomplish the latte makeup trend. Who knows, it may just become your signature makeup look — read on for the scoop!</p><h2>Best Latte-Inspired Face Makeup</h2><p><strong>1.
