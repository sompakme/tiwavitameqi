It's hard to escape the pressure of being thin when everywhere you look there are models, actresses and singers that are beyond thin. Whether Photoshop is involved or not, society's portrayal of body image has raised criticism from people all over the world. Beauty should not be defined by your weight, it should be defined by the way you live your life and the way in which you take care of your health.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being in the spotlight comes with a lot of pressure. Many women in Hollywood find it hard to maintain that perfect body without going overboard. With the amount of pressure put on female celebrities in today’s society, it comes as no surprise that many pass the point of being fit and begin to look sick. Eating disorders are extremely common in show business and some stars find it hard to lose weight fast enough in a healthy way.</p><p>This unrealistic and unhealthy body image which is portrayed by many celebrities sends off a negative impression&nbsp;in regards to how women should look. Eating disorders have become an increasingly serious problem&nbsp;over the last few years and the fact that many celebrities are abnormally thin has something to do with it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Girls idolize celebrities and strive to look like them at all costs. Hollywood should begin pushing healthy body images or the problem will continuously worsen. The following 15 celebrities are famous for all kinds of different things, however, they are all known for being scary skinny. Love them or hate them, the following thin celebrities all need to sit down and eat a burger or pizza or both because looking at them is enough to&nbsp;make anyone hungry.</p><h2 id=15-denise-richards><strong>15. Denise Richards</strong></h2><p><a title="Denise Richards Net Worth" href=#>Denise Richards</a> has been in the spotlight for years. Actress, mom and ex wife to notorious bad boy <a title="Charlie Sheen Net Worth" href=#>Charlie Sheen</a>, she has always been known as one of Hollywood’s sweethearts. Denise is an undeniable talent and classic beauty, however, in recent photographs her dramatic weight loss overpowers her stunning face. Perhaps she is under a lot of stress, but for the past two years her weight has been a topic of discussion in countless gossip magazines. Richards who was once known for her incredible body should put some weight back on and get her perfect beach body back on track.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-selma-blair><strong>14. Selma Blair</strong></h2><p><a title="Selma Blair Net Worth" href=#>Selma Blair</a> is famous for being a secondary character in epic movies like Cruel Intentions and The Sweetest Thing. In her older films, she has a plump face and natural body, however throughout the years, this mother of one has gotten scary skinny. Blair and baby daddy Jason Bleick, who is a fashion designer, broke up in 2012 and her weight has been drastically going down ever since. The gorgeous star’s health&nbsp;has been in&nbsp;debate throughout the tabloids since then and fans are curious to see how she will look in her upcoming films this year. Hopefully she didn’t loose her talent along with all that weight.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-kate-middleton><strong>13. Kate Middleton</strong></h2><p><a title="Kate Middleton Net Worth" href=#>Kate Middleton</a> is under a lot of pressure. After marrying into the royal family and becoming a mom, she must be extremely busy and looks like she doesn't even have time&nbsp;to eat! Her thin figure caught the attention of the world at her lavish Royal Wedding to <a title="Prince William Net Worth" href=#>Prince William</a>. Although many women lose weight before their weddings, Kate’s weight loss was extreme. Even when she is pregnant, the Princess keeps her skinny frame. Either Middleton has extremely slim&nbsp;genes, or she does not eat enough because she is beyond thin. Whatever it may be, we have confidence that this poised beauty has control over her life and will seek help if she sees her weight as problematic.</p><p></p><h2 id=12-leann-rimes><strong>12. LeAnn Rimes</strong></h2><p>This American singer has slowly been becoming thinner and thinner with time. This pop country star has been involved in the tabloids for many things in the past few years. <a title="LeAnn Rimes Net Worth" href=#>LeAnn Rimes</a>&nbsp;and <a title="Eddie Cibrian Net Worth" href=#>Eddie Cibrian</a> had an affair, breaking up two marriages. Although that should have been the tabloids' main focus, somehow the stories always went back to her weight. Her borderline sickly appearance alarmed America and forced them to question her health and eating habits. The singer and her new husband tried to star in their own reality show and failed miserably. Hopefully now she will focus on her weight and get back to looking healthy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=11-julie-bowen><strong>11. Julie Bowen</strong></h2><p>Everyone loves <a title="Julie Bowen Net Worth" href=#>Julie Bowen</a> on the incredibly hilarious television show Modern Family. This busy and talented mother of three is said to be somewhat similar to her amazing character Claire. Although she is great&nbsp;at her job and loved by all her fans it is undeniable that Bowen is beyond skinny. Many have commented and criticized her for her body. Bowen claims to just be a working mother who enjoys working out, however many find that hard to believe. Julie Bowen is a great talent and a charismatic woman but&nbsp;her body is way too thin.</p><p></p><h2 id=10-miley-cyrus><strong>10. Miley Cyrus</strong></h2><p><a title="Miley Cyrus Net Worth" href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> has alarmed a lot of her fans with her recent extreme weight loss. Cyrus, who is a self proclaimed party girl, seems to keep getting thinner and thinner. Miley&nbsp;has always denied having an eating disorder but many of her loved ones feel like her whirlwind&nbsp;lifestyle may be the end of her. She is known to be up all night partying and smoking and dancing until the break of dawn. Cyrus is a great talent and we hope that she does not lose herself too much, and of course we also hope she doesn’t loose too much weight. Fans who have recently seen her have all been saddened by her freakishly skinny appearance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-kate-bosworth><strong>9. Kate Bosworth</strong></h2><p><a title="Kate Bosworth Net Worth" href=#>Kate Bosworth</a> won the heart of America when she starred in the hit film Blue Crush. After this film aired, every boy wanted to date her and every girl wanted to be her. With her stunning face, unique two-toned eyes and her smoking hot body, she was known as the perfect girl next door. Her once athletic body slowly began to diminish and she has been skin and bones since about 2006. The once effervescent starlet has lost her appeal to many due to her frightening figure. She will be appearing in a few films this year and we are looking forward to seeing if she has put some meat on those bones!</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-tori-spelling><strong>8.

The Olsen Twins</strong></h2><p>Although <a title="Mary Kate Olsen Net Worth" href=#>Mary Kate</a> has always been the one under scrutiny, both her and her twin sister <a title="Ashley Olsen Net Worth" href=#>Ashley</a> have seemed to struggle with eating disorder.

Since then, the duo have created an empire and at the same time earned&nbsp;university degrees. Although the sisters appear in fewer productions than they did when they were kids, they are still super famous.

Kate Moss</strong></h2><p><a title="Kate Moss Net Worth" href=#>Kate Moss</a> is one of the world's most famous and renowned supermodels. Although she insists she was never anorexic, Moss is not known to be the healthiest of stars. Her extremely thin figure has been linked with her use of drugs such as cocaine. Moss has always been criticized for her weight, the 5 foot 7 model has been as thin as 100 pounds, not the most healthy image. Although Moss has made herself famous from being extremely thin, she has now been said to have added a few a few pounds to her body.
