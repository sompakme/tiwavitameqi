You will see it this season,” Shay, 38, teased <a href=#>about the upcoming drama.</a></p><p>Season 11 picked up three months after news broke that Sandoval and Madix called it quits due to his affair with <strong>Rachel “Raquel” Leviss</strong>. Vanderpump <a href=#>broke her silence days after</a> the scandal made headlines in March 2023 by asking that Bravo viewers tone down their anger toward Sandoval and Leviss, 29.</p><p>“It’s a show, but [the cast is] all hurting. And I am not saying we should let them off the hook,” she said during an appearance on WWHL. “Condemn their actions but don’t condemn the people. All this [online] aggression has serious ramifications. I really mean that — I think everyone should be careful.”</p><p>Vanderpump subsequently <a href=#>filmed with both Madix and Sandoval</a> in additional footage that was captured for season 10. She faced backlash from fans and cast members alike for showing Sandoval support on screen.</p><p>Madix admitted on WWHL in May 2023 that she found Vanderpump to<a href=#> be a “little too nice to” Sandoval</a> during the season 10 finale. Vanderpump, for her part, stood by the decision to show Sandoval some compassion at a low point in his life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Scheana-Shay-Says-Lisa-Vanderpump-Has-Softer-Spot-for-Tom-Sandoval-Than-Ariana-Madix-After-Scandal-NUP_202121_02169810.jpg><p>“Everybody else was chastising him. I didn’t feel like joining the pack. I mean, it seemed so kind of slanted. Everything was against him, you know?” the restaurant owner exclusively told Us Weekly at the time. “I’ve known him for a long time. Of course, I’m condemning what he did. That’s why I said, ‘You’re not a bad person. You just did a bad thing.’ And my heart was always with Ariana. Maybe I didn’t kind of, you know, scream at him and lambast him, but everybody else had done that.”</p><p>Vanderpump added: “The man that was sitting in my living room, it felt like a broken man. So, I just didn’t want to pile on, to be honest. Have I had conversations and held him accountable? Yes, I mean, I felt the same way, absolutely, that everybody else did. But at some point, they’re like my children in some way.”</p><p>The<a href=#> Real Housewives of Beverly Hills </a>alum noted that it was hard for her to choose a side.</p><p>“They’ve grown up with me. … You might scream at him for a second, and I did that before, but when I saw him, then you’ve gotta try to at least move forward or look for the path forward — even though it was too early to move forward [or] look for the path forward,” she concluded. “But of course, we were all very upset. We felt duped. We were disgusted, we were hurt — all of those things.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Vanderpump later <a href=#>showed her love for Madix</a> when she attended the <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars </a>season 32 finale in December 2023. Vanderpump got emotional while watching Madix almost win on the ABC dancing competition show.</p><p>“I never knew she was capable of anything so magnificent,” Vanderpump told cohost <strong>Alfonso Ribeiro</strong>. “I’ve watched every week, and it’s brought tears to my eyes.”</p><p>Season 11 of Vanderpump Rules airs on Bravo Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET and is available to stream on Peacock the next day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK2pqqNiuaq%2FwGatmqaUmr%2BxwcypZKGZo2LAsLLTZqqpp6Ris7C%2BjK2mpmWjlrulu9Wao2aZlqmys3nDq5immV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
