Instead of being at home and having a consistent routine, <a href=#>Nicole was on the road with her parents, Karen Moss</a> and Peter Michael Escovedo. Karen was an employee of Sheila E., otherwise known as Sheila Escovedo, Peter's sister. Both were out touring with bands often to make ends meet, which meant that Richie's needs were not being met at the time.</p><p>The first time that Lionel Richie witnessed this was when Nicole was on stage with Prince at two years old. She was playing a tambourine and having the time of her life. But behind the scenes, Nicole's family life was falling apart. Bills were not able to be paid, Nicole was being bounced from one family member to another while Peter and Karen would go on tour, and Peter and Karen were having marital troubles at the time as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lionel witnessed this first-hand when Peter went on tour with him. It was then that Lionel offered to let Nicole stay with him and his then-wife, Brenda, so that Nicole could have a routine. But a short timeframe turned into years and, after Nicole had been there for more than two years, Lionel and Brenda Harvey offered to adopt her. The adoption happened when Nicole was nine years old; only one year later, <a href=#>Lionel and Brenda had an acrimonious divorce</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lionel-richie.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Brenda Harvey-Richie Only Had One Child With Lionel, But Her Relationship With His Other Kids Is Surprising</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Brenda Harvey-Richie and Lionel Richie share one child, but given their history, it's surprising how she relates to his other kids.</span><p>After Nicole's formal adoption, Karen was in and out of her life. Peter was much less involved. Over the years, Nicole has forgiven her biological parents and even built a relationship with them. While Nicole Richie was given to Lionel Richie at age three, her biological father is in the picture today, albeit living a dramatically different lifestyle than Nicole.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicole-richie-39-s-father-is-peter-michael-escovedo>Nicole Richie's Father Is Peter Michael Escovedo</h2><h3 id=peter-michael-escovedo-has-played-percussion-for-some-of-the-biggest-names-in-the-music-industry>Peter Michael Escovedo has played percussion for some of the biggest names in the music industry</h3><p>Nicole's father is Peter Michael Escovedo.

Instead, be it because of his schedule or because Nicole chose not to have a relationship during her formative years, Nicole and Peter were not close.

However, when the acting out turned to something larger with Nicole becoming out of control, she turned to illegal substances.</p><p>The reason for Nicole's use of illegal substances was something that she attributed to "being bored." Later, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole wanted to make things right in her relationships</a>, first with her adoptive parents and then with her biological ones for being so hard on them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I kind of took matters into my own hands and was creating drama in a very dangerous way," Nicole explained. "I think I was just bored, I had seen everything—especially when you’re young, you just want more."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/instar53203333-1.jpg><p>The reunion of sorts with Karen and Peter came when Nicole found out she was pregnant. Any anger or animosity she had toward them, Nicole wanted to get rid of. Instead, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Richie wanted to mend fences</a> and be the type of parent her "child would look up to."</p><p>"When I found out that I was pregnant, there was just something inside of me that felt a responsibility to mend any issues that I've had with my parents in the past, because, listen, I've put them through a lot," Nicole said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Nicole-Richie.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Sad Truth About Nicole Richie's Weight Loss</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Nicole Richie has had a turbulent weight loss journey made so much worse by the media who were obsessed with her image.</span><p>While her relationship with Peter is not as close as it is with Karen, any ill-feelings that Nicole had toward them have been let go, which helped Nicole heal and ensured that she would have a healthy relationship with her children as well.</p><h2 id=what-peter-michael-escovedo-is-doing-today>What Peter Michael Escovedo Is Doing Today</h2><h3 id=peter-michael-escovedo-continues-to-work-in-the-music-industry-today>Peter Michael Escovedo continues to work in the music industry today</h3><p>These days, Peter is still working in the music industry.

There is not an exact figure as to Peter's net worth, but from all outward appearances, it does not look like he is struggling to make ends meet.</p><p>As far as the relationship between Peter and Karen, multiple sources suggest they remain married. However, in 2016, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a biography on Peter suggested he was in a relationship with a woman named Patrice</a>. The two were reported to live a bohemian-type lifestyle, preferring to live below their means in Southern California.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brrInKalnV2ntqS0yJ5km6GfobyotcKao2ackZl8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
