While the news came as a shock to fans, it was claimed at the time that the band <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">simply didn’t see eye-to-eye on the group’s overall musical direction</a>, which had led to plenty of creative differences in the months leading up to their split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of that, Nick, Joe, and Kevin had previously taken a one-year hiatus backing 2010 to 2011, and while nobody expected the trio to part ways, it seemed as if this particular time apart made them realize that working on their individual projects was the best way moving forward — especially if they can’t seem to agree on the group’s direction.</p><p>While Kevin went on to star in his very own reality show and become somewhat of a TV personality, Joe and Nick were committed to launching their solo careers — and that’s exactly what they did.</p><p>If you’ve kept up with the JoBros, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who have since reunited</a>, since their heyday in the late ‘00s, you’ll already know whose career has fared better than the other, but between Joe and Nick, who has been able to attain a bigger net worth?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-s-richer-nick-or-joe>Who’s Richer: Nick Or Joe?</h2><p>Prior to their split in 2013, the band had released their last album before the breakup in 2009 with Lines, Vines, and Trying Times.</p><p>The album was a commercial success, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 200 while entering the Top 10 in countries such as the UK, Spain, Italy, New Zealand, Australia, and Argentina.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans React To Miley Cyrus Dedicating The Song ‘7 Things’ To Punish Nick Jonas</a></span></p><p>Two singles were lifted from the project, “Paranoid” and “Fly with Me,” while the record itself was supported with their seventh concert tour which included seven legs and a total of 43 shows from August 2010 to November 2010.</p><p>After the tour, the Jonas Brothers were back to working on their individual careers, with Joe wasting absolutely no time to commence work on his debut album, Fastlife, which he went on to release in October 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With production work from the likes of Danja, Chris Brown, Hit-Boy, and Adonis, it looked as if Joe’s album was coming together pretty well. But in the lead-up to the release, there was very little marketing and promotion going on, which most likely affected the project’s sales.</p><p>Fastlife debuted at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 200.</p><p>Joe later formed the group DNCE, and funny enough, he ended up having more success with them than he did on his own, thanks to their 2015 single “Cake by the Ocean,” which shot up to No. 9 on the Hot 100 and pushed a whopping 5 million copies in the US alone.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Celebrate Their Love For Demi Lovato On The 13th Anniversary Of Disney’s ‘Camp Rock’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The track’s worldwide sales have since surpassed over 8 million units, making this Joe’s biggest hit outside of the success that came with being part of the Jonas Brothers.</p><p>They released their debut album DNCE in November 2016, but following the JB reunion in 2019, the band went on an indefinite hiatus.</p><p>His brother, Nick, on the other hand, waited until 2014 to put out his self-titled second album, Nick Jonas.</p><p>His first album was released back in September 2005 — when he was just 12 years old and long before the Jonas Brothers was even a thing — but the record had a limited release and failed to chart.</p><p>This time around, however, Nick had a smash hit single on his hands with “Jealous,” which went on to sell over three million copies worldwide and later include a remixed version with R&B singer Tinashe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nick Jonas peaked at No. 6 and received favorable reviews from critics who described the new batch of songs as a solid offering from Nick.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Jonas Reveals The Jonas Brothers’ Breakup Hit Him ‘Like A Tsunami’</a></span></p><p>The Dallas native also started dedicating part of his time to a career in acting, having starred in a string of blockbuster flicks including Jumanji, Midway — not to mention he also had a recurring role in the TV series Kingdom, which ran from 2014 to 2017.</p><p>As previously mentioned, the Jonas Brothers ended up reuniting in 2019, which was followed by the release of their fifth album Happiness Begins. The album debuted at number one with first-week sales of 414,000 copies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kevin, Joe, and Nick also embarked on a world tour, appropriately titled Happiness Begins Tour, which consisted of 92 shows and generated an incredible $121 million at the box office.</p><p>This was then followed by the release of album number three for Nick with Spaceman, which dropped in March 2021.</p><p>According to Celeb Net Worth, Nick has amassed a $70 million fortune while his brother Joe’s net worth stands at a cool $40 million.
