The Amazon owner and <a href=#>absurdly jacked billionaire</a> does his best to keep his lifestyle far away from the public eye. But bits and pieces are released, painting a picture of a man who knows how to enjoy his reported <strong>$195.9 billion (as of March, 2024) net worth</strong>.</p><p>This includes purchasing <strong>a $2.5 million engagement ring</strong> for his now-fiance Lauren Sanchez. But Sanchez is used to the life of luxury. Both of her ex-husbands have also been exceedingly rich men. But money isn't the only thing they gave her. Sanchez also was given three children from her two previous relationships. This includes Nikko Gonzalez, who is the only one of Sanchez's children to be in the spotlight.</p><p>Nikko appears to be used to a life of luxury.

But is he doing anything worthwhile with his money like MacKenzie Scott is?</span><p><strong>Updated March 2024:</strong>In January 2024, Nikko Gonzalez made his runway debut with Dolce & Gabbana. While he did not post his show on social media, his mom, Lauren Sanchez did. Whether this was a one-off for Gonzalez or if he is trying to make a career out of modeling is unknown.</p><p>Bezos' children have continued to remain out of the spotlight, as have Sanchez's children with her ex-husband, Evan Whitesell.</p><h2 id=what-are-jeff-bezos-39-children-39-s-names>What Are Jeff Bezos' Children's Names?</h2><h3 id=jeff-bezos-39-oldest-child-39-s-name-is-preston-but-his-younger-sons-and-adopted-daughter-39-s-name-have-not-been-made-public>Jeff Bezos' oldest child's name is Preston, but his younger sons and adopted daughter's name have not been made public</h3><p>Jeff Bezos does an exceptional job keeping the identities of his four children private. But when you have the kind of power, money, and influence that he does, it's to be expected. However, given the social media age we now live in, it seems almost impossible. Yet, few news publications have any details on <strong>the four children Bezos has with his former wife, MacKenzie Scott</strong>, with whom he had a relationship for over 25 years. Of course, Scott appears to be living her best life after <a href=#>her $38.3 billion divorce settlement</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bezos too has moved on with Lauren Sanchez.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jeff-bezos-fiance-lauren-sanchez-amazon-owner-rings-of-power-screening.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Gawker,</a> the only one of Bezos' children who has appeared publicly with him is his eldest, Preston. He is the only one of Bezos' children who has been named in public.</p><p>It is believed that Preston may go to MIT or Princeton. As for Bezos' other sons, well, they may appear in a couple of images on both their father's and future step-brother's Instagrams. Although they could be mistaken for Jeff Bezos's nephews from his brother Mark, who also keeps a low profile.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>One of their names appears to be George</strong> while another could be <strong>Dean</strong>. However, Gawker claims that 'Dean' is a pseudonym for George who may go to Yale. Jeff Bezos' nephew Owen has appeared in images on Bezos' Instagram and is easily mistaken for his son.</p><p>Even less is known about Jeff Bezos' daughter, whom he and <strong>MacKenzie Scott reportedly adopted from China</strong>. But she is likely to be much younger than her older brothers.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jeff-bezos.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>There's An Explanation For Why Jeff Bezos' Kids Are Anonymous (And His Fiancée's Son Is All Over Social Media)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Not much is know about Jeff Bezos' kids, but his fiancée's son flaunts his lifestyle all over social media.</span><p>Presumably, Jeff Bezos ensures that the media doesn't catch wind of the true identities of his mysterious children <strong>to keep them safe from the public</strong>. The fact that each of their Instagrams remains private seemingly confirms that his kids also want to maintain anonymity.</p><h2 id=who-is-lauren-sanchez-39-s-son-nikko-gonzalez>Who Is Lauren Sanchez's Son Nikko Gonzalez?</h2><h3 id=nikko-gonzalez-is-the-son-of-both-lauren-sanchez-and-ex-nfl-star-tony-gonzalez>Nikko Gonzalez is the son of both Lauren Sanchez and ex-NFL star, Tony Gonzalez</h3><p>Before getting engaged to one of the richest men in the world, Lauren Sanchez was with Pro Football Hall of Fame's Tony Gonzalez. Very little is known about their relationship except that they had a son together, Nikko.</p><p><strong>While Sanchez's son is now in his 20s, she also has two much younger children with talent mogul, Patrick Whitesell.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/instar53392853-1.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Style</a>, the co-CEO of William Morris Endeavor and the entrepreneur and helicopter pilot were <strong>married from 2005 until 2019</strong>. During that time they had two children, Evan Whitesell, who was born in 2006, and Eleanor, who was born in 2008. Once again, little is known about Sanchez's relationship with Whitesell, but, according to Style, <strong>it's rumored that Whitesell was actually the one who introduced Sanchez to Bezos</strong>.</p><p>It's unclear if Whitesell and Sanchez are on positive terms, but it is clear that she and her first husband, Tony Gonzalez have a very positive relationship. Gonzalez has been spotted a few times on double dates with his ex and Jeff Bezos. He's also been invited to various parties thrown by Bezos, including his 2021 New Year's Eve party aboard his yacht in Saint Barts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/instar50780660-1.jpg><p>In one image from the party, Lauren Sanchez's eldest son Nikko can be spotted with both his NFL legend father and future step-father. This positive bond obviously suggests that Nikko is a fan of his mother's extremely rich man.</p><h2 id=inside-nikko-gonzalez-39-s-extremely-lavish-lifestyle>Inside Nikko Gonzalez's Extremely Lavish Lifestyle</h2><h3 id=nikko-gonzalez-travels-extensively-and-is-a-professional-model>Nikko Gonzalez travels extensively and is a professional model</h3><p>While Jeff Bezos' children are extremely private about their lavish lifestyle, his step-son, Nikko, certainly isn't. While Nikko Gonzalez doesn't post a lot on his Instagram, the few images he has reveal a lot about his day-to-day life. This includes an image of him lying shirtless at the bottom of an empty pool on a yacht deck (which is presumably one of Bezos' own mega-yachts).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/untitled-design-2023-05-24t195115-366.jpg><p>Nikko's Instagram depicts him as an often-shirtless, rich boy, happy to be enjoying the lavish life that he was brought up with. This includes images of him casually hanging out at fancy restaurants around the world, including in Paris, France, swimming with sharks in Bora Bora, climbing waterfalls in Maui wearing nothing but his underwear, and partying on Jeff Bezos' mega-yacht in Saint Barts.</p><p>Nikko also appears to be an avid skier, or, at the very least, a talented one. In a post featuring what looks like his stepbrothers on Jeff Bezos' side, Nikko can be seen jetting down a mountain in Yellowstone Park with the grace and agility of a pro skier.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lauren-sanchez-s-lifestyle-is-outrageously-expensive-here-s-the-truth-about-how-jeff-bezos-spoils-his-fiance.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Lauren Sanchez's Lifestyle Is Outrageously Expensive: Here's The Truth About How Jeff Bezos Spoils His Fiance</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Lauren Sanchez certainly doesn't mind enjoying Jeff Bezos' Amazon fortune in some truly insane ways.</span><p>Then, of course, there are a handful of images of Nikko Gonzalez's gorgeous girlfriend, Ginebra.</p><h2 id=who-is-nikko-gonzalez-39-s-girlfriend-ginebra>Who Is Nikko Gonzalez's Girlfriend, Ginebra?</h2><h3 id=it-has-not-been-confirmed-that-genebra-is-nikko-gonzalez-39-s-girlfriend-but-the-two-are-clearly-close>It has not been confirmed that Genebra is Nikko Gonzalez's girlfriend but the two are clearly close</h3><p>At the time of this writing, we cannot even confirm that Nikko Gonzalez's girlfriend is named Ginebra. But this is what is said on her Instagram (@ginebss). We know very little about this social media influencer. However, according to images on her Instagram, she has been dating Nikko Gonzalez since at least early 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/untitled-design-2023-05-24t194929-161.jpg><p>Ginebra appears to have just as lavish of a lifestyle as her boyfriend, traveling around the world with a number of her model friends. Given that she is friends with so many established models such as Kailand O. Morris, Quinn Elin Mora, and Jordan Barrett. According to her Instagram, Ginebra is also friends with Forrest Whitaker's daughter, True.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nikko's mom, Lauren Sanchez, appears to be a fan of her as she often comments on Ginebra's photos. This includes captions like "Yes, Princess", "Pretty girl", "Birthday Girl, love you", and "Beauty".</p><p>Ginebra is also present at some of the parties that Jeff Bezos throws for his family and friends. According to The Daily Mail, she was also spotted out for dinner with Sanchez, Nikko, and Jeff Bezos's eldest son Preston at Nobu in Malibu in April 2023.</p><p>So, while little is known about her relationship with Nikko Gonzalez, it appears as though she's enjoying the benefits of his famous family.</p><p>Source: The Daily Mail</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnp6WYq%2Bmxs6sZJygmaGxs7HNZp2imZ6Ysm7Dx6hkoqtdoa62vsSnZKyZnpi1psaMrKanZZ6euKy7jKCmp7KRobK7ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
