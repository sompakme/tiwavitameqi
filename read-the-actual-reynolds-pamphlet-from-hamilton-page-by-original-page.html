Alexander Hamilton’s affair with Maria Reynolds, and his subsequent hush-hush payoffs to Maria’s husband James, have backfired, and rumors are beginning to circulate that Hamilton has been not only cheating on his wife but also illegally speculating with federal funds. In 1797, he took to the press himself, publishing an outraged 98 pages under the title Observations on Certain Documents Contained in No. V & VI of “The History of the United States for the Year 1796,” In Which the Charge of Speculation Against Alexander Hamilton, Late Secretary of the Treasury, is Fully Refuted. Or, as it’s commonly known, the Reynolds Pamphlet.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-8eb75070932e5aa056d29ffc79559a63-4-0-1@published data-word-count=130>It was printed in Philadelphia, and in the window below, you can read it page by page, courtesy of the New-York Historical Society. (The Society’s putting the Pamphlet on exhibit, too, from January 15 through 29.) It’s not the easiest for modern eyes to read, not so much because of Hamilton’s writing (which is, relatively speaking, pretty brisk) but because the “long s” — that is, the typographical style of substituting a lowercase <i>f</i> for a lowercase <i>s</i> in the majority of places — is distracting. (If you find it too eye-fatiguing, there’s a modernized transcription <a href=#>at the National Archives site</a>.) If you can make your way through the “extenfive and complicated mifchiefs,” what reveals itself is an extremely vigorous defense. Hamilton, as we know from <i>Hamilton</i>, begins by saying:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/9d7/653/184883d2e094b676d841e7fb20eb5bb7ae-ChristopherBonanos.2x.rsquare.w168.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-8eb75070932e5aa056d29ffc79559a63-6-0-0@published data-word-count=45><i>I owe perhaps to my friends an apology for condescending to give a public explanation.

But that bosom will approve, that even at so great an expence, I should effectually wipe away a more serious stain from a name, which it cherishes with no less elevation than tenderness.

But he thought he could preserve something of his reputation by exposing everything.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-8eb75070932e5aa056d29ffc79559a63-20-0-0@published data-word-count=47>What happened afterwards? “Ultimately Maria Reynolds filed for divorce,” she says, “and her attorney was Aaron Burr! New York was a small town.” And, as <i>Hamilton </i>(and Ron Chernow’s biography, on which the show is based)<i> </i>reveals, Eliza and Alexander’s marriage did survive. <a href=#>Forgiveness.
