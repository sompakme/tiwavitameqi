For her own protection,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one person wrote on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter). A different comment read, “She is just a puppet for him,” while another added, “Definitely agree there/ but it might just be away also for him to try to control her also like he tried to do with the rest.”</p><p>In the last few weeks, Kanye has been on a streak of sharing nearly-naked photos of his wife online, though it’s not the first time he’s posted explicit images of her online. But what makes the timing of his latest post interesting is that it comes following reports that Bianca is pregnant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ttweb_a-look-at-kim-kardashian-s-net-worth-since-divorcing-kanye-west_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>A Look At Kim Kardashian's Net Worth Since Divorcing Kanye West</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Kim Kardashian knows how to leverage her fame, so it's no wonder her divorce has barely made a dent in her net worth.</span><p>Earlier this month, speculation began stirring online after Bianca was photographed in numerous occasions in clothing that was uncharacteristically more oversized and modest than she’s become infamous for wearing in the last year – for instance, she <a href=#>almost faced a fine for public indecency</a> while traveling with Ye in Italy in the summer.</p><p>Moreover, paparazzi photos seemed to show Bianca specifically trying to shield her abdomen from photographers, causing some fans to theorize she may have a growing baby bump that she didn’t want to be revealed to the public.</p><h2 id=kanye-and-bianca-are-also-facing-reports-of-marital-problems>Kanye And Bianca Are Also Facing Reports Of Marital Problems</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kanye-west-lawsuits-and-liens.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kanye West already has four children with his ex-wife <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, who has expressed that she won’t be having more children. However, Ye himself hasn't voiced similar sentiments, leaving the possibility open for expanding his family with Bianca. The pair legally tied the knot just a month after Kanye finalized his divorce from Kim in December 2022.</p><p>Though Bianca and Kanye have been presenting a united front recently, it wasn’t long ago the couple reportedly took a break after an intervention was staged by Bianca's loved ones (though they seemed to reconcile before the holidays). However, reports indicate that <a href=#>Kanye may not be fully committed to salvaging their marriage</a>, prioritizing his career comeback and upcoming album instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Concerns have also surfaced regarding Bianca's spending habits. According to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">source cited by In Touch ,</a> Bianca has been making substantial purchases using Kanye's credit cards and cash, leading him to feel exploited. The source highlighted ongoing issues in their relationship, suggesting Bianca struggles with a "spending problem."</p><p>Despite these challenges, Bianca has been by Kanye's side during recent public appearances, including those promoting his new music. Reports suggest that Kanye's upcoming <a href=#>music will shed light on their high-profile marriage</a> through its lyrics (and potentially their future plans for expanding their family).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiimqapmnq4sdKtZKydlaLAbsDOZpidnKKawLR5waKYp5uRYrCmutKoqaKrXaW%2FprPNmqWcsV2nwq670axkp6uWrHqxtM6tpmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
