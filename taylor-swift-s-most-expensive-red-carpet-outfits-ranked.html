Her place among the most successful pop stars of all time is set in cement, with multiple Grammy awards to show for it. Steady rise from a heartbroken singer, who was mentally stuck in high school, to an eccentric lady no afraid to take the world by storm.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-in-oscar-de-la-renta-for-the-world-premiere-of-cats---17-990>Taylor Swift in Oscar de la Renta for the world premiere of Cats -&nbsp;$17,990</h2><p>Taylor struck her second red carpet look three days after she hit the big 30. A spectacle on the red carpet with a Oscar Hayman’s sapphire ring, which costs a whopping $13,500. A pair of $199.50 Chloe Gosselin Narcissus shoes gave her a regal look for the night. Perhaps, the meeting between her eccentric floral gown and its isle-worthy train combined attractively to lend a dramatic gait to her movement that night.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 30-year-old <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">churned out</a> $17,990 to serve such a significant fashion statement. Heads will keep turning to catch a glimpse of her luxurious look even in the middle of a storm. If the singer's dress hadn’t made a statement, fans would have normed her signature red lips based on familiarities.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-in-j-mendel-for-times-100-gala-2019---6-990-gown>Taylor Swift in J. Mendel for Times 100 Gala 2019 -&nbsp;$6,990 Gown</h2><p>The 2019 edition of Times 100 Gala was a big night for Tay. Not only was she an honoree, but the songstress also performed a five-song set. The event brought out Taylor Swift in all her awesomeness, and her outfit did much to cap it all up.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Crazy Expensive Things Taylor Swift Has Bought</a></span></p><p>She had to flaunt her Marilyn Monroe-esque looks. From her Lorraine Schwartz pieces of jewelry to the embellished sandals that adorned her feet, nothing on her fashion list for the night came cheap. The singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">really showed her standards</a> with this $6,990 J. Mendel strapless hand-pleated silk gown. The dress got a taste of perfection with floral embroidery.

The 2016 Vanity Fair Oscar Party presented another side of the singer’s red carpet taste. She rocked an Alexandre Vautheir look in a never-been-seen Taylor style. With a freshly cut blunt bob, she bared some skin in the split-to-the-navel, high side split floor-length dress.</p><p>To further adorn the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">look</a>, Tay accessorized with a gold choker and a complimenting gold purse. That’s not all there is to her 2016 Vanity Fair outing, which turned out to be one of the <a href=#>country singer</a>’s all-time favorite looks. A quick probing into her daring fashion statement reveals that the dress doesn’t come close to anything regular. She spent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nothing less</a> than £4,600 on it. Her look was made perfect with a Jimmy Choo clutch and a pair of Giuseppe Zanotti shoes. She pulled off the most unconventional look of the night.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-in-julien-macdonald-for-the-2019-american-music-award---28-870>Taylor Swift in Julien Macdonald for the 2019 American Music Award - ≥ $28,870</h2><p>If there’s one thing we can be almost sure of, it is the fact that Taylor had successfully&nbsp;dropped her country girl side as of 2019. The 2019 American Music Awards was another unforgettable award night for the singer. With a couple of nominations, she made sure to strut the red carpet in style, wearing a Julien Macdonald costume made ready-to-wear dress.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Rules Taylor Swift Followed To Achieve Success</a></span></p><p>One thing Taylor’s fans may never get tired seeing is the singer in glittery dresses. This time, she made sure to switch things up a little with her $735 elastic boots. The fully embroidered, deep green dress was made perfect by diamond hoops and rings from Ofira jewels. Her AMA look is of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">upwards</a> of $24,135 - without the custom made dress, which costs nothing less than $4,000.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-in-elie-saab-for-the-2012-billboard-music-awards---4-250>Taylor Swift in Elie Saab for the 2012 Billboard Music Awards -&nbsp;$4,250</h2><p>By 2012, the songbird’s fashion evolution had only begun to mature.

You can only bet that she'll look stunning in it just as she did in the sheer lace bodied Elie Saab gown. The singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">doled out</a> $4,250 for this one.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-in-mary-katrantzou-for-the-2014-mtv-video-music-awards---8-615>Taylor Swift in Mary Katrantzou for the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards -&nbsp; $8,615</h2><p>Taylor has got the long legs, and she flaunts them every time she’s not strutting the red carpet in floor-length gowns with long trains. The singer sported a different look from the other celebs at the 2014 MTV VMAs red carpet. Her $8,615 Mary Katrantzou piece <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">screamed</a> all the words letters on the dress could not form.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Times Taylor Swift Forgot To Look In A Mirror</a></span></p><p>Her lotus lace playsuit left many fans wondering, could those imprints be some cryptic message?

The singer was possibly in high spirits ahead of the release of her latest album. Her outfit, far from her usual red carpet shenanigans, beamed of bright enthusiasm. Unsurprisingly, she received the first-ever Icon Award the same night.</p><p>The enchanting looks would not have been an easy one for anyone to guess before the event. Tay’s Versace montage-print bodysuit, high-rise baroque-print shorts, and signature print blazer didn’t disappoint her fans. What's more, her $4,357 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">outfit</a> left many style pundits in much more awe.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-in-louis-vuitton-at-the-2016-met-gala---4-345>Taylor Swift in Louis Vuitton at the 2016 MET Gala -&nbsp;$4,345</h2><p>Taylor took to the MET Gala red carpet rearing to serve a look that will go down the history of her fashion repertoire as one of her edgiest ever.

She doubled as one of the co-hosts of the event and sustained the theme on a night we all witnessed her put in a resounding T.V. personality shift.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Golden Globes 2020: The 10 Best-Dressed Celebrities, Ranked</a></span></p><p>The Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology-themed gala had the singer on her ‘A’ game. Just like her 2014 hit song, there was a Blank Space, and she wrote her name with her $4,345 Louis Vuitton <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">custom dress</a> and sandals. A Diamond Crack Ring, a Snake Ring, and Diamond Ear Cuff were all part of the Louis Vuitton ensemble from Eva Fehren.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-in-raisa-and-vanessa-for-the-2019-billboard-awards---3-258>Taylor Swift in Raisa and Vanessa for the 2019 Billboard Awards -&nbsp;$3,258</h2><p>Once the red carpet rolls out, Taylor Swift never fails to walk it with beauty and elegance. Alternating between her signature looks, and risqué but classy styles are one thing the singer knows best. One time, it is Taylor in floral dresses, other times she's swaggering the red carpet in jumpsuits. High slit gowns, ball dresses, and sheer gowns are among her many looks over time - and she does it to perfection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is never surprising to see her switch her fashion game.

As usual, she pulled it off perfectly.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-in-oscar-de-la-renta-at-the-2019-billboard-women-in-music-event---2-990>Taylor Swift in Oscar de la Renta at the 2019 Billboard Women in Music Event -&nbsp;$2,990</h2><p>All that could be said of Taylor Swift's fashion sense when she first laid claim to fame was her tacky, 16-year-old country-girl taste. Over a decade later, just some hours to her 30th birthday, the singer clinched another major award- Billboard’s Woman of the Decade award.</p><p>To receive this honor, she stepped out in grandeur adorned in an Oscar de la Renta jumpsuit. Another aspect of Tay’s fashion, you may say. Asides her remarkable acceptance speech, Taylor’s fans had a lot of comments on her $2,990 asymmetrical chain strap jumpsuit.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Of Taylor Swift's Biggest Fashion Fails</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBosXLqKlmq6ees7W%2FjKamrKxdmsWxsc2soK%2BdXaeypXnCmqmpnaRivLbAxaKrrGWilrusscNo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
