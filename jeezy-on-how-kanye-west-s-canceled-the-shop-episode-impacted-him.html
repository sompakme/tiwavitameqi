That’s just how I’m rocking.” Jeezy continued, adding, “I was a little like, ‘Damn. They canceled me. I gotta go see Ebro now. I got a project coming out.’”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Jeezy also revealed how he was informed that his episode wouldn’t air and says he doesn’t hold any grudges against any of the parties involved for the outcome. “I can’t say I understood why they took it off. I just know that I came there, we did it, and I got a call. They said, ‘It’s a wrap.’ I didn’t take it personally.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-979821336.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Atlanta rep’s comments come in the wake of news of The Shop‘s decision to pull the plug on Kanye’s planned episode, citing incendiary remarks the Donda 2 rapper made during its filming.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Maverick Carter, one of the heads of the show, <a href=#>released a statement </a>addressing the move and his refusal to give Kanye’s divisive views a platform.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Kanye was booked weeks ago and, after talking to Kanye directly the day before we taped, I believed he was capable of a respectful discussion and he was ready to address all his recent comments, the Ohio native said. “Unfortunately, he used&nbsp;The Shop&nbsp;to reiterate more hate speech and extremely dangerous stereotypes.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch Jeezy’s interview with the Ebro in the Morning team below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2BypsbYZqKapqmaerix0q1kraCVYsCpu89mnKmho6SxpnmQa2ptb2BohXmAjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
