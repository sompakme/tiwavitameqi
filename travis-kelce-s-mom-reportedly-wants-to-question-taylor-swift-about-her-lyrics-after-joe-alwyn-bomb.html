The exes broke up in April 2023 after six years of dating, with fans eager to know the reason behind it.

Taylor’s potential future mother-in-law. The NFL mom said she plans to ask Taylor about some of the meanings behind her new music, including which songs are about her son, Travis.</p><p>“I know there’s a few that some people think are about Travis but we’ll just see,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Donna, 71, shared with Us Weekly</a> during an appearance at the QVC Women’s Summit in Las Vegas. “You know, I’ll have to ask her when I see her.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It appears Donna hasn’t since Taylor recently, which isn’t surprising given the singer’s hectic schedule. She’s traveling the world on her Eras tour while doing promotional work for her 11th studio album. Travis has been flying across the globe to meet her, with reports <a href=#>saying he’ll join her on the European leg</a> of her tour.</p><p>Donna did admit she’s already listened to the entire album, which has 31 songs, say she heard it the “day it was released.” While Mrs. Kelce admitted she didn’t “really” have a favourite song, she said the album is her favorite of all of Taylor’s repertoire.</p><p>“It’s her best one!” she told the publication.</p><h2 id=travis-is-in-ldquo-awe-rdquo-of-taylor-over-her-new-album>Travis Is In “Awe” Of Taylor Over Her New Album</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift-4.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Travis hasn’t shared his thoughts on Taylor’s new work, sources say he continues to be impressed by his girlfriend. He apparently listened to the album before it released (and before his mom, too).</p><p>"He is always in awe of her," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told PEOPLE</a>.</p><p>Many fans are curious to know Travis’ opinion, given that the album goes into such detail about Taylor’s past relationships. It also appears to make a series of revelations about her relationship with Alwyn. At the very least, it hasn’t quelled speculation about that relationship, despite it ending over a year ago.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:47</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ttweb_we-tracked-down-every-time-taylor-swift-has-cried-on-stage-and-why-_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>We Tracked Down Every Time Taylor Swift Has Cried On Stage (And Why)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's live performances are always special, and she's been known to cry on stage every now and then.</span><p>While reports said Alwyn was worried about how Taylor’s album would portray him, though he also apparently <a href=#>has no plans to address it publicly</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Joe has not said one word about Taylor or their breakup and has been completely respectful of her,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told Daily Mail</a> before the album came out. “It’s undeniable that the name of her upcoming album is in reference to Joe’s WhatsApp group chat.”</p><p>“If it is a diss album, that is shady. He helped her with song writing on her past album [under pseudonym William Bowery on Folklore and Evermore] so it will really come as a shock to him if she talks about their breakup, as it is something he has not spoken of at all,” they continued. “Regardless of what she does, he will still not respond because he has removed himself from her narrative and is very glad he did.”</p><p>Who knows, perhaps Travis’ mom will be the one to get Taylor to spill the details on who all her songs are about (even the Joe ones).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp6rXaK8rnnWmqWtq12mwqa%2F06Kmp2Wklsatu9FmqrChlql6rcXRopqsZZqksm6ty7Cwp2WSpLqjv8eeo6WrXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
