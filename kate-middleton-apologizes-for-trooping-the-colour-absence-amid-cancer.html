As you can imagine, this has taken time,” Kate said in <a href=#>a March announcement video</a>. “I am well and getting stronger every day by focusing on the things that will help me heal in my mind, body and spirits. Having William by my side is a great source of comfort and reassurance too, as is the love, support and kindness that has been shown by so many of you.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Kate — who shares her three children with William, 41 — has canceled all of her public-facing duties in order to recuperate.
