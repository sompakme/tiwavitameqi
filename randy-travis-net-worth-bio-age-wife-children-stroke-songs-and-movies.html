He was born on May 4, 1959, in Marshville, North Carolina. </strong><span id=more-517></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=randy-travis-music-and-acting-career></span>Randy Travis Music and Acting Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When he first began his career in music, he used his official name Randy Traywick before as his stage name of which he changed twice to Randy Ray and then later became Randy Travis, he chose Travis in honor of his musical idol, Merle Travis.</p><p>While his brother was serving jail time for a high-speed car chase, Randy won a talent contest at a nightclub, in Charlotte, North Carolina. Elizabeth “Lib” Hatcher, the club’s owner, took an interest in the young singer, she hired Randy as a cook, and gave him frequent singing jobs at the club. During the late 1970s, Randy worked and sang at Country City USA in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p><p>While in his late teens, Travis had another encounter with the law. At his court appearance, the judge told Travis that if he ever saw him back in that court, he would automatically go to jail for a long time. Travis was eventually released into the guardianship of Hatcher, who also doubled up as his manager. The pair began to focus on Randy’s career full-time.</p><p>He recorded a self-titled album, Randy Traywick in 1978, for Paula Records in 1978. The next year, he released two unsuccessful singles, “She’s My Woman” and “Dreamin’”.</p><p>Throughout the early 1980s, Travis was turned down by every major record label in Nashville. His early demo tapes were scrutinized by record executives as being “too country.” To support them, Hatcher served as a manager of a nightclub, The Nashville Palace. Travis recorded an independent album Live at the Nashville Palace in 1982, Hatcher used the album to acquire a deal with Warner Bros. Records.</p><p>As part of the contract, label executives requested the duo to keep their romance affair a secret, and changed his stage name again, to Randy Travis. In 1985, the label released the single “On the Other Hand” which peaked at No. 67 on the country charts. The following year Warner Bros. re-released “On the Other Hand”, which became Travis’ first number-one hit song.</p><p>In 1992, Travis took a music hiatus to concentrate on acting and landed roles in numerous Western-genre films. He later returned to recording music with the 1994 album This Is Me and the hit single “Whisper My Name”.</p><p>Travis parted ways with Warner Brothers three years later and signed a record deal with DreamWorks Nashville. He recorded You and You Alone, which gave the top 10 hits “Out of My Bones”, “The Hole” and “Spirit of a Boy, Wisdom of a Man”. After his good friend George Jones died in April 2013 Travis recorded “Tonight I’m Playin’ Possum,” in Jones’ memory.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=randy-travis-age-and-birthday></span>Randy Travis Age and Birthday<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was born on May 4, 1959, in Marshville, North Carolina, United States.
