With her resonant voice, buoyant charisma, and Latin roots, Cabello was a standout member of the band, which formed while competing on the second season of Fox’s The X Factor in 2012.</p><p>After the show ended, the singer and her bandmates enjoyed several years of break-out success, scoring two Top Five Billboard 200 albums with 2015’s Reflection and 2016’s 7/27, and spawning the hits “BO$$,” “Worth It,” and “Work from Home.” While still with the group, she began branching out, collaborating on “I Know What You Did Last Summer” with Shawn Mendes and “Bad Things” with Machine Gun Kelly</p><p>However, it was after her heavily publicized departure from Fifth Harmony in 2017 that Cabello achieved her biggest success, debuting on top of the Billboard 200 with Camila, and nabbing her first solo number-one single with “Havana.”</p><p>she fostered her love of music by listening to Celia Cruz and Alejandro Fernández. At the age of 15, Cabello auditioned for The X Factor in Greensboro, North Carolina. Even though she was eliminated (along with her four future groupmates), the judges brought her back. Simon Cowell combined the girls into a quintet and formed Fifth Harmony.</p><p>Despite finishing in third place, they went on to be the most successful contestants from that season. The group’s debut EP, Better Together, was released in October 2013, with acoustic reworkings, Spanish versions (Juntos and Juntos Acoustic), and a remix album following a month later. Their debut single, “Miss Movin’ On,” was the highest-charting U.S. X Factor single at the time, a feat beaten only by each successive Fifth Harmony single.</p><p>The group’s debut LP, Reflection, was released in early 2015, featuring the hits “Sledgehammer”&nbsp; and “Worth It,” featuring rapper Kid Ink. While backstage on Taylor Swift’s 1989 world tour, Cabello wrote a duet with Canadian singer/songwriter Shawn Mendes. “I Know What You Did Last Summer” was released in November 2015 and immediately hit the Billboard Top 20. Fifth Harmony’s sophomore set, 7/27, was issued in 2016, supported by a world tour and the hit single “Work from Home.”</p><p>In May 2017, Cabello released her debut (non-album) solo single, the Sia Furler co-wrote “Crying in the Club,” which peaked in the Top 40 of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. She also joined Bruno Mars as the opening act on his 24K Magic World Tour. In early 2018, she returned with her debut full-length solo album, Camila, featuring production by Frank Dukes, Jarami, and others.</p><p>Buoyed by the singles “Havana” featuring Young Thug and “Never Be the Same,” the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. A second version of “Never Be the Same,” featuring country singer Kane Brown, arrived in 2018. By year’s end, she had also picked up several Grammy nominations, including Best Pop Solo Performance for a live version of “Havana” and Best Pop Vocal Album.</p><p>Following a tour, Cabello returned to the studio and in June 2019 and issued the single “Señorita” with singer Shawn Mendes.

In December 2019, Cabello released her sophomore full-length album, Romance, which featured songwriting and production contributions by Andrew Watt, Finneas O’Connell, Justin Tranter, and others.

Despite her best efforts, Mendes seemingly didn’t want to hang out much. “I remember I wanted to hang out with you, but you were always on the tour bus, just learning guitar,” Cabello told her boyfriend in their interview. Mendes added that Cabello was the only person who would “talk” to him on the tour and that he thought she was “insane.” I thought you were out of your mind. I’d be on my bus where no one could see me. I’d be looking through the window and I’d see you like, flying around on a scooter and jumping and doing cartwheels. I’d be like, she’s insane. Close the window and go to sleep,” he joked.<h4>September 2014: Camila Cabello Tweets At Her Future Boyfriend</h4><p>“shawnyboy!!!! gonna miss ya man,” Cabello tweeted. “you rock but you would rock more if you laughed when i said uteruses before duderuses.

Cabello shared that the song was about a crush gone wrong in an interview with Rolling Stone.</p><p>“At the time, I was talking to a guy that I liked, and a friend called me two days before we wrote the song and told me he had been hitting her up and trying to flirt with her as well,” Cabello revealed.</p><h4><strong>April 2018: Shawn Mendes Shares More Love For Camila Cabello&nbsp;</strong></h4>“I don’t think you’ll ever meet somebody who can feel emotion like her, in all aspects,” Mendes told Beats1 of Cabello. “She can feel hurt like no other, but she can feel love like no other.” On Twitter,&nbsp;Cabello wrote in response&nbsp;to the sweet interview,&nbsp;“i shouldn’t be crying at this time in the morning but I AM. i love you SO much @ShawnMendes.”<h4>June 2019: Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello Drop “Senorita”</h4><p>After many supportive tweets and gushing interviews, Cabello and Mendes finally drop another song. “Senorita” is as steamy as they come, and features the pair getting hot and heavy in a motel room.</p>“You say we’re just friends / But friends don’t know the way you taste,” croons Cabello in the song.
