Though Harry was headed to see his grandmother due to her ailing health, it was reported that <a href=#>Meghan chose not to visit</a>. Sadly, it would be the couple's last chance to visit with the Queen, as she passed away in the afternoon at Balmoral.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Immediately upon the Queen's death, her son Charles, next in line for the throne, immediately became King.</p><p>King Charles' reign will likely not be without drama, as his relationship with his now-wife and alleged former mistress Camilla Parker Bowles has long created controversy, with many people <a href=#>considering the former Duchess to be the "most awkward" royal</a>. In fact, royal fans were upset when it was revealed that <a href=#>Camilla would one day become Queen Consort</a>.</p><p>Camilla, who was formerly the Duchess of Cornwall, does indeed have a new title, now that her husband is King.</p><h2 id=camilla-parker-bowles-is-officially-the-queen-consort>Camilla Parker Bowles Is Officially The Queen Consort</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because the crown is passed to the next in line for the throne immediately, King Charles immediately became England's king when his mother passed away. As his wife, Camilla automatically became Queen Consort.</p><p>However, for anyone unfamiliar with how the British monarchy works (like readers in the United States!), the title doesn't make Camilla Queen in the traditional sense.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Queen Elizabeth Had A Strict Rule After Finally Agreeing To A BBC Interview">Queen Elizabeth Had A Strict Rule After Finally Agreeing To A BBC Interview</a></span></p><p>Though Queen Consort replaces Camilla's Duchess of Cornwall title, she does not have an official coronation. Per Royal.uk, the consort's coronation ceremony typically <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">happens alongside their Queen or King's</a>.</p><p>For example, Prince Philip, the late Queen's husband, was Prince Consort. When Queen Elizabeth was crowned, so was he.</p><p>The site does note that the ceremony for a Consort is simpler, but they do note the ceremony happens "unless decided otherwise." This suggests that should they want to, King Charles and Queen Consort Camilla could do something different.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-the-queen-want-camilla-to-sit-on-the-throne>Did The Queen Want Camilla To Sit On The Throne?</h2><p>Queen Elizabeth was often criticized for her lack of public statement on some matters, including the passing of Princess Diana. Yet <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she did make a public statement about Camilla's then-future title</a>, paving the way for King Charles to make Camilla his Queen Consort with, theoretically, less backlash from his people.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Who Are The Queen's 12 Great Grandchildren?">Who Are The Queen's 12 Great Grandchildren?</a></span></p><p>Though it's impossible to say what Queen Elizabeth's feelings were on the matter, she made her official stance clear in stating that Camilla would sit alongside King Charles when the time came.

This was Prince Philip's royal duty to his wife Queen Elizabeth II, and it's a model that the monarchy has used for ages.</p><p>Of course, depending on what King Charles decides to change or establish as the monarch, things could change.</p><p>Obviously, Camilla will not be birthing any heirs to the throne, so the line of succession is as it was prior to the Queen's passing; Charles becomes King, and Prince William is next in line, followed by his three children.</p><p>Prince Harry comes fifth in line after his brother, niece, and nephews.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=would-camilla-be-queen-if-charles-dies>Would Camilla Be Queen If Charles Dies?</h2><p>Another common question from outsiders not knowledgeable about the British monarchy is whether Camilla would become the reigning Queen if King Charles passed away. The simple answer is no — she would not.</p><p>The monarchy passes to the next heir, which would be Prince William, should his father the King pass away.</p><p>Camilla would keep her title, and possibly be retitled with "Dowager," which is a term used for widowed Queen Consorts, but she would not be a Queen in any sense.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Much Is Camilla, Duchess Of Cornwall Worth?">How Much Is Camilla, Duchess Of Cornwall Worth?</a></span></p><p>Online commenters on Quora speculated about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what her title would become if her husband passed awa</a>y after becoming King.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many suggested she might customize her title somewhat, or revert to Duchess of Cornwall — or even combine titles to be referred to as HRH (Her Royal Highness) The Duchess of Cornwall or, if another Duchess exists for Cornwall (William and Kate became Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge upon the Queen's passing and the King and Queen Consort's title changes), then HRH Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.</p><p>All of that is pure speculation, of course, because there's no telling what could change between now and when King Charles III's reign ends.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecKapKKknJbAbsDIraOeZZ6kxG7Ax5qrZpuYlr%2BtsdJmoKxlm567qHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
