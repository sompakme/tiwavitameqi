The family of three were decked out in cozy brown sweaters. Paytas opted for a chocolate sweater dress while Malibu’s cream pullover had the words “big sister” emblazoned in a cursive font. Both Paytas and her little one held up the official sonogram photos in several snaps.</p><p>Several of Paytas’ friends including <strong>Tana Mongeau</strong>, <strong>Julia Fox</strong> and more congratulated her on the exciting news.</p><p>“OMGGGG!!!! Yessss GO TRISH!!!!! ❤️,” Fox, 33, commented, while Mongeau, 25, responded that she and pal <strong>Brooke Schofield</strong> were “screaming” and “crying.”</p><p>Hacmon, meanwhile, posted a <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok</a> announcement video of his own. The clip included several photos from Paytas’ post and a behind-the-scenes video of his daughter walking around on the grass.</p><p>Paytas was appreciative of all the love. “I’m always shocked (and humbled) by how many people care ❤️ we are over the moon,” she wrote on <a href=#>X</a> (formerly Twitter) on Thursday. “Happy it’s finally out there 🤰🏼.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Courtesy-Moses-Hacmon-Instagram3.jpg><p>Paytas and Hacmon, who tied the knot in December 2021, <a href=#>welcomed Malibu</a> in September 2022.</p><p>“She has arrived. Malibu Barbie Paytas-Hacmon born 09.14.22 at 8.9 lbs and 21 1/2” 💕🙏🏼🥹,” she wrote on X, alongside photos of her newborn.</p><p>Before learning <a href=#>she was pregnant</a> with her first child, Paytas struggled with fertility issues. While announcing she was expecting, Paytas recalled the ups and downs of her journey to motherhood.</p><p>“We have been trying since October 2020 and testing every month together. After 1 year of testing together, I started just doing it on my own because it was always negative and really disappointing,” she captioned an emotional February 2022 video. “We went to a fertility center after our wedding in December where they did the HSG test on me and we got pregnant that cycle.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Paytas said she had been told several times that she would not be able “to get pregnant naturally.” Despite receiving the bad news, she persevered — and encouraged her followers to do the same.</p><p>“Don’t give up hope, don’t be afraid to get help. And it’s other people’s miracle stories that kept me trying which is why I wanted to share mine,” she shared. “At 33 (almost 34), I truly didn’t think it would happen. I’m so so grateful and thankful.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGayp6WpwqOx0Warq6Gjna5uvMCyq5qrXaW%2FprPNmqWtZZWtvaav06KloGWSlq%2B6ec2oZGtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
