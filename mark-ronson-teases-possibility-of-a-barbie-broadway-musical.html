That’s our other bomb, but we’ve never been able to merge them,” Ronson said of the song, adding that the film’s script was “so inspiring” and the track “came to us pretty quickly.”</p><p>Ronson also noted that he doesn’t know if they’ll be “as lucky to get that kind of a script every time,” but they “really did love working on this.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mark-Ronson-Teases-Possibility-of-a-Barbie-Broadway-Musical-3.jpg><p>“Once we saw Ryan’s performance, as well, we were still making the song. We were like, ‘Oh my God, we’re going to have to dress the song up in the equivalent of a white mink and two sunglasses,’” he said. “And then we called Slash… basically we were so inspired by everything.”</p><p>Ronson gave a shout out to Gosling, 43, in his acceptance speech for the award.</p><p>“Ryan Gosling, this is as much your award as ours,” Ronson said. “You made the audience fall in love with this song with your matchless performance, so thank you.”</p><p>He also gave thanks to director Gerwig, 40, saying, “The fact that you carved out 11 minutes for this prog-rock, power-ballad, dream-ballet, shred fest so the boys could cry and hold hands a little too, we’re really forever in your debt for that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mark-Ronson-Teases-Possibility-of-a-Barbie-Broadway-Musical-4.jpg><p>While Ronson took home the Critics Choice award on Sunday, he previously <a href=#>lost his nomination</a> for Best Original Song for both “I’m Just Ken” and <strong>Dua Lipa</strong>’s “Dance the Night” at the <a href=#>2024 Golden Globes</a> earlier this month.</p><p>In a series of snaps from the awards show posted via Instagram, Ronson included a pic of his trash can that contained his acceptance speech seemingly ripped up. Although neither of his tracks took home the Golden Globe, the award went to <strong>Billie Eilish</strong> and her brother, <strong>Finneas</strong>, for another Barbie song: “What Was I Made For?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSaqptiv7C60qilZqyVlsCmv4yppqyrmZe2rbXTsmSonl2WeqOt0ZugnmWSp7yisNaasGalpai2pK3LaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
