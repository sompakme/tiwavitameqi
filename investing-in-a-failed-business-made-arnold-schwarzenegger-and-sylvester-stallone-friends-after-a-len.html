Since Stallone and <a href=#>Schwarzenegger starred in many incredibly successful films</a>, many people may have assumed they were content. In reality, however, <a href=#>Schwarzenegger and Stallone were jealous of each other</a>.</p><p>As a result of that jealousy, Stallone and Schwarzenegger infamously feuded for years. Many of their fans don't realize what led to the two action stars becoming friends after years of bad blood.</p><h2 id=why-did-arnold-schwarzenegger-and-sylvester-stallone-feud>Why Did Arnold Schwarzenegger And Sylvester Stallone Feud?</h2><p>Over the last several years, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone have both delighted in talking about their former feud.

When I think, my movies started become more bigger and bigger. But he was always ahead of me career-wise and money-wise. When I was making a million dollars a movie, he already was making ten million dollars a movie."</p><p>Schwarzenegger continued, "So he was ahead, but then eventually I caught up and that's when the s**t hit the fan. He didn't like that. I didn't like him, you know, kind of all of sudden getting into my turf and having a ripped body. All of a sudden he was like out there with the ripped body."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/investing-in-a-failed-business-made-arnold-schwarzenegger-and-sylvester-stallone-friends-after-a-lengthy-feud.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Everyone would walk to me and say, 'Can you believe Stallone's body?'"

So, we started sort of, despising each other. We couldn't co-exist. It was one of those stupid things where he looked at me like the enemy and I looked at him as the enemy."</p><p>At the height of Schwarzenegger and Stallone's rivalry, the two actors actively rooted against each other. Most notably, <a href=#>Schwarzenegger tricked Stallone into starring in three of his worst movies</a> by taking advantage of his peer's jealousy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering how bitter Schwarzenegger and Stallone's rivalry once was, it is amazing they are close friends now.</p><h2 id=how-did-arnold-schwarzenegger-and-sylvester-stallone-become-best-friends>How Did Arnold Schwarzenegger And Sylvester Stallone Become Best Friends?</h2><p>After many years of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone hoping each other's films would fail, all that changed.

Around the thirty-six-minute mark of Schwarzenegger's "WTF with Marc Maron" appearance, he explained how he and Stallone became pals again. As it turns out, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stallone and Schwarzenegger getting involved in the same business brought them together</a>.</p><p>"We realized it was a game for us because deep down inside, I respected him and I thought that everything he did was really great, and he was like, multitalented.

I didn't have the skills to direct movies like he did."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Schwarzenegger continued, "In the end, when we became friends again because of Planet Hollywood.

Of course, I am disappointed that the company did not continue with the success I had expected and hoped for.”</p><p>In 2002, Stallone actually filed a lawsuit over his Planet Hollywood involvement. Stallone sued his former business manager for convincing him not to sell his Planet Hollywood stock before the company went bankrupt. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stallone sought $17.3 million in the lawsuit</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq6afobFuv8Khrpqqqpq7prPGnqlmq6mhw6a%2F056pZquklrmtu82eZJ%2BqmZq7pb%2BMmp2tnaJis6bBw2admqGcmrFuvMuapZ6sXZ28rbjYsKaonF2eu7ex0q2knqakZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
