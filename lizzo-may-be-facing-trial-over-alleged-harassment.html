The women filed the complaint with their attorney, Ron Zambrano of West Coast Employment Lawyers on Tuesday (Aug. 1).</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Since the report surfaced, <a rel=nofollow href=#>other allegations</a> including workplace misconduct have surfaced — all of which Lizzo has denied. After the <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1234727833>Grammy winner </a>issued a statement on the matter, Neama Rahmani, president of West Coast Employment Lawyers, responded with the following:</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Given Lizzo is denying that any of this happened, let’s take it to trial. More witnesses are coming forward every day corroborating the plaintiffs’ allegations, so we’re looking forward to facing Lizzo and her team in court.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Davis also responded to the backlash she is facing about an audition video for season two of <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234692844>Watch Out For The Big Grrrls</a>, which was reportedly made prior to the alleged abuse.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So imma just sit this here.<br>This is Arianna Davis the woman who is accusing Lizzo of fat shaming her,and is now suing her.<br>I need a timeline!! <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/shh3nu4v3q</a></p>— HoneyyDeww?️‍?✨ (@elisa_TyC) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 3, 2023</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Of course, I wasn’t going to say anything negative about the camp while I was still in it,” said Davis.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She continued, “Right up until the last minute, I didn’t realize how bad it was and how much I was being taken advantage of. I just genuinely wanted to save my job. This video further explains how much I was trying to please Lizzo. But it was such a <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234720991>toxic work environment </a>because throughout all the abuse, I was still trying to please her and make her think that I was good enough. This video was done before the bulk of our allegations occurred, and this was just me grasping at straws and my last attempt to make her see how committed I was to being loyal to her and her camp.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Zambrano released a statement shortly after <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234777207>the bopstar</a> shared a statement across social media. “Lizzo has failed her own brand and has let down her fans,” it reads. “Her denial of this reprehensible behavior only adds to our clients’ emotional distress. The dismissive comments and utter lack of empathy are quite telling about her character and only serve to minimize the trauma she has caused the plaintiffs and other employees who have now <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234754489>come forward </a>sharing their own negative experiences. While Lizzo notes it was never her intention ‘to make anyone feel uncomfortable,’ that is exactly what she did to the point of demoralizing her dancers and flagrantly violating the law.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234718420>About Damn Time</a>” singer is calling these claims “sensationalized stories” and is now reportedly being represented by Marty Singer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6G2u8bOZpilpJWcsqV5x5qpmqujorKvwIytqaKZnGLAta3TnqSepqRifnN%2Fk3BucHBiaHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
