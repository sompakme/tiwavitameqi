So what is our point, exactly? Well, what if we could combine these two things together to create the perfect shoe? Well, maybe we can’t . . . but we’re thankful becasue Sam Edelman already did!</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam Edelman Regis sandals</a> are wedge platform shoes that do everything right. If we had a physical checklist of everything we wanted in a warm-weather shoe, our marker would be running out of ink. That’s how obsessed we are! And guess what — it’s our lucky day, because these sophisticated slides are on sale!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Black-2.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam Edelman Regis sandals</a> (originally $70) starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$49</a> at Zappos!</strong></p><p>This shoe is racking up the reviews, and shoppers are calling it both the “perfect summer cork slide” and a “must-have for spring.” We plan to turn it into our favorite for fall, too. Many reviewers agree that we “can’t beat the price” on <a href=# data-link=1>sandals</a> like these that look super expensive and are of such high quality, but are currently starting at under $50. They’re even “comfortable right out of the box!” No wonder so many are saying that these are their daily go-to shoes for work and beyond!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These wedge sandals</a> have either a saddle leather, patent leather, metallic leather or genuine haircalf upper, depending on the color we choose. We were impressed with the intricate strappy design of this upper at first glance, but we were thrilled when we looked a little closer and realized the straps actually formed a specific silhouette — the Sam Edelman double “E” logo! We can even find a smaller hardware version of this logo on the strap closest to our ankle!</p><p>These shoes have a slip-on style and an open toe to show off our pedicure — or motivate us to finally schedule one. They have a cushioned footbed with an embossed design, making them an easy choice for all-day wear, and topstitching detail around the border that contrasts beautifully!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Leopard-1.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam Edelman Regis sandals</a> (originally $70) starting at just<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $49</a> at Zappos!</strong></p><p>The wedge heel and platform of this shoe are connected and wrapped in cork. The heel is 2.5 inches high and the platform is 1 ¼ inches high, giving us just enough of a boost to deliver all of the flattering effects of a heel without affecting our ability to walk. Underneath, we’ll find the outsole, which is made of crepe rubber. Crepe rubber provides great traction, but is softer than other rubber materials, making it potentially the most comfortable sole option out there that’s still incredibly durable! This means better shock absorption, less foot fatigue and less knee and even back pain!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These shoes</a> are currently available in six colors, one of which is a leopard print! That would be the haircalf one. There are also multiple brown and black options with major versatility, as well as a polished leather with a metallic sheen! Two of these styles are the full 30% off, but every single color is on sale right now!</p><p>Shoppers recommend going up half a size to find the perfect fit in these Regis sandals. Once we do, we might as well throw all of our other shoes into storage, because we’re never going to want to slide these off!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sam Edelman Regis sandals</a> (originally $70) starting at just<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $49</a> at Zappos!</strong></p><p><strong>Not your style?
