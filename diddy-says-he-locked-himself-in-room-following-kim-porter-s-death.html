He reveals he closed himself off from the world, including his children, during this period, locking himself in a room for months as he attempted to emotionally regroup.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’m going to be honest with you,” the legendary mogul began. “Right before the pandemic, after I had lost Kim, I locked myself in the room for a year as I’m changing. Justin [Combs] can tell you, I barely spoke to my kids, barely spoke to anybody.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-51677072.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“So it gets rough. The not giving up. I mean, I think that you do give up, then you have to un-give up and you have to pull through. And it’s a process. When you think about the music industry, this is not a strange story,” he said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The cultural icon credited prayer and his faith in a higher source with helping to pull him from out of that rut and be able to move forward in life. “Only 1 percent of people in the music industry survive with all their marbles and aren’t depressed and actually are able to make it through their storm,” he shared.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“So I just pray every day and give thanks that I’m able to have today. Every day I wake up, I got a second chance at life. So I just want to vibrate higher. If I walk in the room, I want you to feel good. If I touch you, I want you everything to be good. I want us to elevate, I want inspire you, I want to motivate, I want us win.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-958605420.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Kim Porter passed away in 2018 as a result of pneumonia.
