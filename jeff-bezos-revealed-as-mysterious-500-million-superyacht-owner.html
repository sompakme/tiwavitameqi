According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Evening Standard</a>, Bezos and his partner, Lauren Sanchez, a helicopter pilot, commissioned the super yacht prior to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">coronavirus crisis</a>, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many of the details of the super yacht have yet to be confirmed, including the ship’s name. For now, it’s only being referred to by its project name – Y721. However, what is known about the yacht is that it will be the biggest and most expensive of its kind. Several details have been revealed by the boat’s Dutch manufacturer, Oceano. It will be 127 metres long – making it longer than the height of the Great Pyramid at Giza. Y721 will also feature a variety of lavish amenities, including a state-of-the-art swimming pool and a movie theatre.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Merchant Wins Half A Million Dollar Battle For Restitution Against Amazon</a></span></p><p>Y721 is reportedly being modeled after the Black Pearl, which is currently the largest and most technologically sophisticated yacht in the world. Launched in 2016 and owned by Russian billionaire Oleg Burlakov, the sailing yacht is a whopping 106 metres long. However, it’s expected that Bezos’ new luxury yacht will surpass the Black Pearl in both size and technological advancement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing Y721 reportedly won’t have is a helipad, meaning helicopters and other aircraft won’t be able to directly land on the yacht. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">City A.M</a>. reports that this is a necessary design choice, as the yacht’s masts will prevent aircraft from safely landing on the ship. Rather, Bezos has reportedly commissioned a separate support vehicle, which will feature a helipad.</p><p>As mentioned, Bezos is reportedly spending $500 million on the luxury ship. However, the costs don’t end there. City A.M. adds that the yacht will likely cost $50-60 million per year in upkeep costs, which is a significant chunk of Bezos’s net worth, estimated to be sitting at around $200 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then again, the businessman reportedly became $2 million richer last week. The Evening Standard explains that, according to Securities and Exchange Commission records, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bezos sold nearly $2 billion worth of shares</a> in his company, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>. The multinational technology company is one of the biggest of its kind, and according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Go Banking Rates</a>, is worth $386 billion.</p><p>It’s likely that more details about Bezos’ super yacht will come forward as its expected to be completed in the coming month. The luxury yacht industry has only seen an increase in popularity since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as many of the world’s wealthiest opt to privately vacation on the sea as restrictions on international travel stay in place in many parts of the world.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon's Journey With Corporate Taxes, Now Bezos Supports Them</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Evening Standard</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">City A.M</a>., <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Go Banking Rates</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3prLFZpmesp%2BoenZ8j2akoqScnryvedKup56qqZawqcCMsm5raV2ksKatzahm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
