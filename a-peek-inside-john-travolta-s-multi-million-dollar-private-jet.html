Each of his private aircraft is registered under the company as a property of the actor. In 2019, the actor made a rare appearance on Jay Leno’s popular automobile show <i>Jay Leno’s Garage</i>, wherein he gave a tour of a Boeing 737-inspired aircraft to eager viewers. His Boeing business jet retails upwards of $57 million and comes with an additional cost of $20 million for its interior renovation and upkeep.</p><h2 id=luxurious-and-fast>Luxurious And Fast</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Travolta’s Boeing Business Jet was constructed in 2010 with Jet Tech’s exterior and registered as YG128. The airstairs lead directly to the entrance of the expansive open-plan area fitted with leather recliner seats. While the original business jet has a seating capacity of 150 passengers, Travolta has customized the flight to seat 15 people in luxurious seats. A large television is situated for in-flight entertainment and dining spaces for meals. It also has two bedrooms for comfort with an ensuite bathroom and shower, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo Movies</a>. The owner’s suite has soft furnishings, a wall-mounted television, and a queen-sized bed. Along with the bathroom, there is a stylish vanity space to dress up before landing.</p><p>The performance of the jet is extraordinary due to the use of twin CFM56-7B27 engines, while the Split Scimitar Winglets help reduce drag and heighten fuel efficiency.

Its incredible fuel range helps it travel up to 6,000 miles at once, taking them anywhere in America and worldwide without hassle. While most celebrities prefer to keep their private aviation in airport hangars, John Travolta keeps his planes at his side.</p><h2 id=closer-to-home>Closer To Home</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2002, John Travolta became an ambassador for Qantas airlines and rented several of their airlines before buying some for himself. Since then, the actor has always wanted to create a private hangar outside his home so he could whisk off in an airline whenever he wants. In the early 2000s, he built a house in Florida that had access to the world with his private jets. As stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, the Qantas Boeing 707 is parked in his backyard in a private hangar. His home has two private runways for landing and take-offs. While the 7,500-foot runway was a bit far from the house, Travolta custom-created a taxiway that could directly access the house.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>While being a trained and professional pilot for many years, John Travolta</a> did experience a hiccup when he dodged a near-death experience in 1992 when he was flying to Washington from his home during cloudy weather. An electric failure caused him to make an emergency landing, but everyone was safe and sound. The actor has since been more careful with the technical details of his private jets.</p><p>Aviation has always been a passion of John Travolta, who began flying as a child and continues to prosper in the field through intense training and flying hours.
