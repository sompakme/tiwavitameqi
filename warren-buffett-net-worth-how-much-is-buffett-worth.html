But the utility of the product would be zilch, and I would be keeping those 10,000 people from doing AIDS research, or teaching, or nursing. I don’t do that though. I don’t use very many of those claim checks. There’s nothing material I want very much. And I’m going to give virtually all of those claim checks to charity when my wife and I die.” – Warren Buffett</p><p>Warren Buffett’s commitment to philanthropy has inspired others to follow in his footsteps.
