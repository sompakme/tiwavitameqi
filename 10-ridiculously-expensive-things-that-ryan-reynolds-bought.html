Before that, though he was no slouch in the movie world. Reynold's has a resume a mile long.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a class=bc-title-link title="10 Ridiculously Expensive Things That Brad Pitt Bought" href=#>10 Ridiculously Expensive Things That Brad Pitt Bought</a></span></p><p>He has been acting in the industry for many years, making his way from romantic lead in romantic comedy films to action star and certifiable movie star. He is also a businessman with a large stake in Aviation Gin. He is married to actress Blake Lively and the two have several children together. We're taking a look at some of Reynolds' most expensive purchases.</p><h2 id=blake-lively-s-engagement-ring>Blake Lively's engagement ring</h2><p>How exactly did Ryan Reynolds get lucky enough to win the heart of a woman as gorgeous as Blake Lively? Well, the two seem to be a match made in heaven so it's not surprising that the Deadpool actor would want to impress her with an equally stunning engagement ring.</p><p>It's estimated that he spent around <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$2 million</a> on the ring which is a 12-carat oval-cut diamond set in rose gold. It also has smaller pav√© diamonds imprinted around the band as well. That's hard to top!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aviation-gin>Aviation Gin</h2><p>If you're a Reynolds fan then you've probably heard the actor talking and raving about the <a href=#>Aviation Gin brand</a>. He bought a large stock in the gin a couple of years ago and likely spent upwards of $600,000 to make that deal happen.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="10 Ridiculously Expensive Things The Cast Of Harry Potter Has Bought" href=#>10 Ridiculously Expensive Things The Cast Of Harry Potter Has Bought</a></span></p><p>He's now a proud owner of Aviation and frequently breaks out the gin during interviews and even to pass around for shots while he's out in public. It's nice to see celebrities indulging in things they are genuinely passionate about. Reynolds reasons for buying the gin brand are simple, he truly thinks it is the best gin out there and he wanted a break from vodka.</p><h2 id=bedford-new-york-country-home>Bedford, New York country home</h2><p>Reynolds and Lively spent more than $5 million on a beautiful rustic mansion set deep in the woods of Westchester County in Bedford, New York. The set-up of the mansion is very suitable to the couple who are known for their chic and fashionable tastes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They also put a great deal of time and effort into renovating parts of the home such as the kitchen to make sure it measures up to their high standards. They bought the house back in 2012 and have lived there ever since. Supposedly according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!</a>, they are very well-liked in the community and are even close friends with their neighbor, Martha Stewart.</p><h2 id=mrs-r-ring>Mrs. R&nbsp;ring</h2><p>As if one exuberant ring were enough, Reynolds also bought Blake another ring should she ever want a break from carrying around that massive diamond. From designer Alison Lou, Reynolds paid $950 to get Blake Lively a gold ring that simply says, "Mrs. R." The ring is 14k yellow gold and Blake has shown it off during multiple occasions.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="10 Ridiculously Expensive Things That Robert Downey Jr. Bought" href=#>10 Ridiculously Expensive Things That Robert Downey Jr. Bought</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Blake sometimes switches to this ring as it is far less expensive than her showy engagement ring which she often keeps locked in a safe as it is one of her most treasured possessions. Reynolds bought her the Mrs. R ring back in 2016. You can even buy your own version if you have about $1,000 to spare.</p><h2 id=18-karat-cupid-s-bow-earring>18-Karat Cupid's Bow Earring</h2><p>Lively must really like rose gold. Ryan Reynolds got her an exuberant Valentine's Day gift not too long ago that includes an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">18-karat rose gold diamond</a> set of earrings from Anita Ko. They cost around $1,700.</p><p>The earrings are shaped like arrows and they go right through her ear lobe. They're gorgeous and Blake explained that her husband was so excited to give them to her that he wound up doing it early. To show how much she loved them, Blake showed them off in public straight away.</p><h2 id=designer-clothing>Designer clothing</h2><p>Just like his wife, Ryan Reynolds is known for being stylish and fashion-forward. He didn't win Sexiest Man of the Year by dressing like a slouch. He spends several thousands of dollars a year on maintaining a top-notch wardrobe, although he doesn't shop nearly as often as his wife Blake Lively does.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Tom Brady: 10 Ridiculously Expensive Things He Has Bought" href=#>Tom Brady: 10 Ridiculously Expensive Things He Has Bought</a></span></p><p>Instead, Ryan prefers to stick with a more subdued and muted wardrobe. But even a white shirt from a top of the line designer is going to cost way more than something you'd find at Wal-Mart. It's all about the brand name at the end of the day and it's easy to spend a lot of money when you're shopping at Dior.</p><h2 id=baked-goods>Baked goods</h2><p>Blake Lively is a fan of the Levain Bakery and Reynolds knows it. It's his first place to go whenever he messes up and wants to ensure that his wife accepts his apology. You'd be surprised how expensive baked goods can be when you're buying them fresh all the time.</p><p>In 2016, Reynolds accidentally revealed the sex of their new baby during a late-night interview on Conan. To make amends, he bought Blake a giant apology cookie from her favorite bakery. The cookie probably cost close to $100.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pricey-watches>Pricey watches</h2><p>Did you know that Ryan Reynolds and Melissa Joan Hart once had a brief thing? Back in the days of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Reynolds guest-starred on the series. He had a bit of a crush on Hart and wound up buying her an expensive Beluga watch. Typically those watches cost anywhere from $500 to $1,000, depending on what kind you're buying.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="10 Ridiculously Expensive Things Anne Hathaway Has Bought" href=#>10 Ridiculously Expensive Things Anne Hathaway Has Bought</a></span></p><p>Since this was still early in his career it was probably on the lower end of the spectrum but still. Sometimes it's hard to remember the days when Reynolds and Lively weren't together. Hart revealed this during an interview with Chelsea Handler.</p><h2 id=wong-house-in-los-feliz>Wong House in Los Feliz</h2><p>Remember when Ryan Reynolds and Scarlett Johansson were married? While together they purchased a beautiful home renovated from 1969. It was known as the Wong House and located in Los Feliz.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It cost about $2 million when they first bought it. The house has a saltwater pool, extensive glass windows, and even a private master suite. Unfortunately, the two eventually divorced and as such the house was put back on the market.</p><h2 id=shoes>Shoes</h2><p>While Ryan Reynolds tends to keep himself clad in simple clothes that are more about comfort than looks, he isn't afraid to spring for expensive shoes. Most of the pairs he owns cost several hundred dollars each.</p><p>While that's not quite the same as Blake Lively, who enjoys Louboutins that are known for having a hefty price tag, it can still add up quickly. Some of his favorite pairs are the Royale shoes and they typically cost about $300 each.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="10 Ridiculously Expensive Things Emma Stone Has Bought" href=#>10 Ridiculously Expensive Things Emma Stone Has Bought</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9GymKdloprGr7vLnapmpZ%2BowW6x16mcp6uZq7JuvNSrmqGZo5rAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
