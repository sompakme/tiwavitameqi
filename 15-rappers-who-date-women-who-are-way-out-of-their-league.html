However, even their incredible success and fame don’t completely explain how they’ve managed to date the most gorgeous women in the world. A majority of these rappers are average-looking and in some cases, below average. Looks aren’t everything, and there are many positive qualities that these rappers have. Regardless, it’s still a mystery what these women find so attractive about these men. Perhaps, some women like their money, status, and popularity or maybe they just like their personalities.</p><p>Rappers are known for having it all and rapping about it. They like fancy jewelry, lots of money, fast cars, and women. In fact, most hip-hop videos feature some of the hottest and most beautiful women in the world. So, it’s really no surprise that these talented artists go after babes that are totally out of their league. They have the money, fame, and confidence to bag a perfect 10. The true mystery is why these women would chase these men. Of course, there are a plethora of male rappers that are handsome and hot. They do pretty well for themselves but they still don’t land some of the women on this list. There is a famous saying that states, “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” This list is clear proof of that. Here is a look at 15 Rappers Who Date Women Who Are Way Out of Their League.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=diddy><strong>Diddy</strong></h2><p>Before <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Rodriguez</a>, before <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc Anthony</a>, and even before <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Affleck</a>, there was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Diddy</a>.

Additionally, he has released several memorable albums, such as&nbsp;No Way Out, The Saga Continues, and Last Train to Paris. In 1999, Diddy and JLo had the entire world buzzing with their relationship. It was quite shocking since JLo’s a perfect 10 and Diddy is…well...Diddy. In December of 1999, they were arrested in connection with a shooting outside of a New York club. They were a regular Bonnie and Clyde. JLo was later exonerated, but Diddy had to go to trail. He was found not guilty of all charges but in the end, he really lost. JLo and Diddy broke up not too long after the trial.</p><h2 id=waka-flocka><strong>Waka Flocka</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Waka Flocka</a> took his name from Fozzie Bear’s catchphrase, “waka, waka.” Waka gives hope to all Muppets fan that they too can proudly represent the show and somehow still date way out of their league.

French was living with fellow rapper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trina</a> but they were never an official couple. Although Trina noted that she was pretty much his girlfriend.
