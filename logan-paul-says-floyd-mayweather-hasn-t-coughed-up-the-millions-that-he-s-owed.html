Mayweather dominated the match for the entire 8 rounds. Paul impressed&nbsp;viewers with his&nbsp;ability to hold his against a world champion. Many predicted that he&nbsp;would get floored by the legendary boxer.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The Atlantic</a>, the fight was a resounding financial success.

If the event pulled in 1 million viewers, his earnings would work out to&nbsp;roughly $5 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A $100 Million Fight: Legend Mike Tyson Says He Would Step In The Ring With Logan Paul For A $100 Million</a></span></p><p>Mayweather reportedly pulled in a&nbsp;$10 million fee for the 24 minutes fight, though the number is likely much high after all is said and done.</p><p>But now Paul is claiming&nbsp;that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayweather still owes him money for the match</a>.</p><p>The YouTuber posted a photoshopped image of Mayweather on his Instagram story with the caption, “pay me my money u f------g corny weasel of a human @floydmayweather.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s unclear what money Paul was referring to, or if he had made some sort of private deal with the boxer.</p><p>When a reporter asked Paul if there would be another fight with Mayweather, Paul responded, "Floyd Mayweather/Logan Paul 2. <a href=#>I don't know, let me get a little better</a>, maybe I can end it next time."</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Jake Paul Dominates The Ring Again In A Rematch Against Tyron Woodley With A K.O.</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirror</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Atlantic</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS5sLPAp2SpmaWherSt2Kxkn6SfrrFuucCyrp6ZpJ2ys3nHmqqnrF2YvLazx56bZq2gYsGpsYymoKWkmaS7tHnToZitZZiawG671p6baA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
