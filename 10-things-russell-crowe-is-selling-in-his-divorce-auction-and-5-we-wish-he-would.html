At first, little was known of the event, but it is now understood to be a divorce sale. Crowe, who married Australian actress Danielle Spencer in 2003, split from his wife in 2012. Since then, the two have decided to get rid of many of the things that they collected over the years. The collection is vast and includes many really incredible things, as well as some very strange things. In total, there are 227 items being sold. Most of the items fall into the following categories, watches, jewelry, cricket memorabilia, and guitars, but there are some very unique and expensive items that we would like to take a closer look at.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The sale, which is hilariously titled, "Russell Crowe: The Art of Divorce," will begin on April 7th at Sotheby’s Australia. In a statement issued by Crowe, he explains why he has made the decision to sell all these items. "Divorce has its way of making you really examine the things that are essential in life — and the things that are not," he said. “Through the process I had a look around and realized I had a lot of stuff. Career stuff, stuff I’ve collected, and stuff in general. Boxes and boxes of stuff…so in the spirit of moving forward into fresh air, here’s a portion of that collection of stuff.” The total price of all the items is said to come in-between $2.8 million and $3.6 million. Here are the 15 Craziest Things Russell Crowe is Selling in His Divorce Auction (And 5 Things We Wish He Would).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-mounted-mosasaur-skull><strong>A Mounted Mosasaur Skull</strong></h2><p>Priced between $35,000 and $40,000, the skull from the large marine reptile is one of the stranger pieces in Crowe's collection. It was acquired in 2008 from the known collector of all things, Leonardo DiCaprio. That alone probably increases the price.</p><p>This is now a skull that Leo touched, maybe even kissed. Measuring about 18.5 inches long, the skull is quite impressive even without the kiss. Of the skull, Sotheby's writes, "The fossil relative of the monitor lizard family, which includes the Komodo Drago, the Mosasaur was a giant, serpentine marine reptile, which was prevalent during the Late Cretaceous Period, approximately 65 million years ago. Mosasaurs were formidable hunters, with a double-hinged jaw and a flexible skull enabling them to eat their prey whole…. The Niobrara Formation is a geologic formation located in North America that was deposited between 87 and 82 million years ago."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cinderella-man-s-jockstrap><strong>Cinderella Man's Jockstrap</strong></h2><p>In the collection are several items from the set of Cinderella Man, including a robe, shorts, a signed boxing glove, and boots, but perhaps none are as interesting or weird as the jockstrap being sold. Apparently, this jockstrap was worn by Crowe while shooting the championship bout between James J. Braddock vs. Max Baer in the film. We're unsure if that increased the price or decreased it because Russell Crowe got pretty sweaty and gross in that movie. Either way, for the low price of $500, you might be able to own a leather suede jock strap worn and sweated in by the great Russell Crowe.</p><h2 id=muhammad-ali-plaster-mask><strong>Muhammad Ali Plaster Mask</strong></h2><p>When Crowe was working on Cinderella Man, he started collecting some boxing memorabilia. While much of the stuff is centered around James Braddock, Crowe's character in the film, he does have a couple of Muhammad Ali items available for auction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Valued at about $1,000, Crowe is selling a face plaster relief cast of the boxing great. The plaster cast was acquired from Angelo Dundee, Ali's long-time trainer and cornerman. It's things like this that really bring to light our weird celebrity-obsessed world. This is a cast of Ali's face we're talking about here. This is a strange timeline.</p><h2 id=violin-from-master-amp-commander><strong>Violin From Master & Commander</strong></h2><p>One of the more expensive items up for auction is the violin used in Master & Commander. Crowe, who insisted on having a legitimate musical instrument on set, had this beautiful Leandro Bisiach picked up for him. The violin was made in Milan in 1890 and apparently sounds amazing when played. Unfortunately, Crowe has not given the instrument its fair share of play time. But he will undoubtedly miss it, saying, "Captain Jack Aubrey’s violin has a special place in my heart. It is a serious concert violin and it should be played rather than just sit accusingly across from me in my office gathering dust."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=errol-flynn-costume><strong>Errol Flynn Costume</strong></h2><p>Russell Crowe has many excellent pieces of film memorabilia, particularly all the different pieces of film wardrobe and clothing he owns. One of the neatest pieces is from the 1947 film,&nbsp;The Adventures of Don Juan, starring Errol Flynn. Crowe is selling (for about $15,000) one of the 14 costumes made for Flynn on the film. The beautiful outfit was not worn on screen, but we wish it was. It is easily one of the coolest of the outfits he had for the film. This piece does have Flynn's name written on the inside of the waistband, so you know it's his. There's also a letter provenance and other proofs. The outfit, which comes from the Oscar-winning film for Best Costume, was gifted to Crowe in 2010, but it could be yours in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gladiator-chariot><strong>Gladiator Chariot</strong></h2><p>Of all the great films that Russell Crowe has made in his career, Gladiator is one of the best-known and most-beloved. It makes sense that Crowe would own so many items from the film shoot because it is the movie that made him a star in America. Of all those Gladiator items, one of the oddest is the chariot. This massive piece of art was acquired from Steve Dent, the horse master on the film. According to him, "The chariots were made by Neil Corbould from the SFX department from the film&nbsp;Gladiator. They were copied from two I bought from Rome off a guy who worked on Ben Hur, the original film."</p><p>The price at auction for this chariot is set between $10,000 and $20,000. Just imagine yourself riding around town in this baby.</p><h2 id=rail-gun><strong>Rail Gun</strong></h2><p>Going for about $5,000, a rail gun from 1710 could be yours if you visit Russell Crowe's divorce auction in April. The bronze rail gun is supported by an iron trunnion mount and perched on a stand. The gun is about 2 feet high and about 3 feet long. We have to assume that Russell Crowe got this gun from the set of Master & Commander or that he simply became very interested in rail guns from that time period during filming. Sotheby's write-up on the rail gun suggests that there is a monogram on the breech. Of what, however, is not clear at this point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dueling-guns><strong>Dueling Guns</strong></h2><p>The dueling guns up for sale in the auction are perhaps the most bad-a*s items of the lot. The F. House guns from the 18th century are said to be in pristine condition. They come encased in a beautiful brown box, fitted with green velvet on the interior. According to Sotheby's description, "The pistols engraved 'No. 1' and 'No. 2', each with a brass barrel, silver plate, and steel fittings and horn-mounted ebonised plunger. Priced between $5,000 and $8,000, if we could buy only one item from this impressive collection, then the gun set would be it." We don't know about you, but we would have to agree with that statement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=life-sized-wooden-horses><strong>Life-Sized Wooden Horses</strong></h2><p>You may not know why you would ever need a life-sized prop horse. You also may not know why you would ever need two of them. But that doesn't mean that the two life-sized prop horses in Crowe's Divorce auction shouldn't interest you. After all, these babies were used for filming Gladiator. If you're curious why they look like they are scared for their lives, well here's what our seller, Crowe, said of the&nbsp;horses, "The two prop horses in my collection were used by Ridley Scott as corpses in the chariot scene in the film, Gladiator."</p><p>So you see, they were meant to look scared for their lives. They were corpses. Go out and buy these fake horse corpses for about $3,000 each.</p><h2 id=life-sized-cricketeer-statue><strong>Life-Sized Cricketeer Statue</strong></h2><p>Of all the cricket memorabilia that Crowe owns and is selling, easily the strangest of all is the life-sized statue of a guy. Being sold for about $55,000, the hollow bronze statue is of Donald Bradman and is "believed to be an artist's proof of an identical figure which forms a part of Captains Walk, a display of forty two bronze statues of past Australian Test cricket captains located at Jubilee Park, in Bradman's birthplace of Cootamundra, New South Wales." So, let's just assume that you understand the rules of cricket and you enjoy it. Maybe having a life-sized Bradman statue on your front lawn is something you see in your future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=johnny-cash-s-1986-grammy-award><strong>Johnny Cash’s 1986 Grammy Award</strong></h2><p>Honestly, owning a Johnny Cash Grammy is pretty cool. For about $250,000, you could have that.</p><p>But before you get too excited about this piece of memorabilia, we wonder if the fact that this Grammy was presented for Best Spoken Word or Non Musical Recording lessens the impact of the prize just a little bit. That's what Cash got it for over 30 years ago in 1986. It was his interviews from The Class of '55 Recording Session that won him this award. Should that really matter though? We're not sure, but that's probably the only reason why Crowe was able to buy the Grammy from the June and Johnny Cash estate.</p><h2 id=the-fancy-ring><strong>The Fancy Rin</strong><strong>g</strong></h2><p>This might be the first one we present on this list, but there is in fact a lot of jewelry up for grabs at Crowe's Divorce auction. Some of it, though, the actor admitted was not a smart idea to buy simply because the pieces were too expensive to ever wear out. Therefore, they basically collected dust. We assume that this incredible $75,000 ring falls into that specific dust-collecting category.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In total, the ring holds approximately 5.13 carats of fancy yellow diamonds, which are surrounded by about 3.5 carats of marquise-cut white/colorless diamonds. All these sparkly money pits are set in platinum and 18-karat white gold. This ring is definitely the prize piece in the jewelry collection. We agree that it might be too nice to ever wear out, though.</p><h2 id=the-vacheron-constantin><strong>The Vacheron Constantin</strong></h2><p>Crowe has plenty of watches up for sale at his Divorce auction, including a Rolex and a Chanel watch that could bring about $50,000 each, but these are definitely not as interesting and impressive as the limited-edition Vacheron Constantin watch. This piece, which has an upper limit price of $60,000, is a circa-2005 Jubilee 1755. The watch is crafted in platinum and was made to celebrate the iconic brand’s 250th anniversary. It is stamped with the Seal of Geneva 27 jewels and even features a 22-karat gold rotor. This is probably another&nbsp;piece of jewelry that we'd be hesitant in actually wearing out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=templar-tunic-and-chain-mail><strong>Templar Tunic And Chain Mail</strong></h2><p>The very templar tunic and chain mail that Crowe wore in the film&nbsp;Robin Hood, is up for sale. Estimated to go for about $20,000, the beautiful piece is more film memorabilia than it is practical (like a lot of the other items in this auction). Not that we expect people to be running around in full chain mail anymore, but the piece is made of synthetic chain mail, not the real stuff. According to Sotheby's, the item is described as "the sleeveless tunic in grey suede with a central crest, together with imitation chain mail composed of synthetic material." Still, the craftsmanship is impeccable, and it really looks authentic.</p><h2 id=gladiator-sword-and-cuirass><strong>Gladiator Sword And Cuirass</strong></h2><p>From Gladiator, Crowe is selling quite a bit. We saw the horses and the chariot. He is also selling prop braces and even the awesome wooden practice sword. But we felt that these two items need their own entry or at least a combined one. These pieces are the cuirass worn by Crowe's character in the final battle, the one in which he dies (spoiler!), and the prop sword he used. Specifically, this was the sword he fought the tiger with (spoiler!).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The cuirass features some beautiful detail and intricate artwork, such as "horses, figures, and griffins." The sword, which also comes with a damaged spare blade, features a "wooden handle applied with classical style brass eagle mounts." Buy them and stage your very own Gladiator fight.</p><h2 id=wish-window-from-a-beautiful-mind><strong>WISH: Window From A Beautiful Mind</strong></h2><p>Of all the great movies that Russell Crowe has been in, nearly every single one is represented in the auction in some way, except for A Beautiful Mind, arguably his best film. Now, when we think about that film, there are very few props that would actually be desirable. It's not really a prop film, after all. There is, however, the window. You know the one in the library that Crowe (as John Nash) writes all over. He does his little formulas and looks like a madman, but we have ti admit that the window does look incredible. That's the one we want. That's what we wish he was selling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wish-longbow-from-robin-hood><strong>WISH: Longbow From Robin Hood</strong></h2><p>Granted, there are a few items from the set of Robin Hood that Crowe put up for sale, but he is not selling any bows, Robin Hood's iconic weapon. We know he has them too. Crowe was a great student of archery while preparing for the shoot and during the making of that film. Admittedly, we are just assuming that Crowe has some old bows. We know he has new bows, but we have to believe that this man who buys classical items on every period film (he does have a mounted mosasaur skull, as well as a chariot from Gladiator) he's ever done would certainly have bought a proper bow. Now, where is he hiding it? And more importantly, why isn't he selling it?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wish-rapier-from-les-miserables><strong>WISH: Rapier From Les Miserables</strong></h2><p>In the collection up for auction, Crowe put up two outfits that he wore on the shoot, a vest and a suit. What we don't see is the rapier he used in the sword fight in the film. Now, we can't be sure that he even owns the rapier, but if we know Crowe, and we think&nbsp;we know him pretty well at this point, we are sure that he picked up at least one of the prop swords before leaving the movie set. After all, this was a huge movie for him, a major production, and the props were absolutely fantastic. Assuming he does have one of the rapiers, we wish he would decide to sell it.</p><h2 id=wish-the-ark-noah><strong>WISH: The Ark Noah</strong></h2><p>Alright, so maybe selling the entire Ark from Noah would be a pretty difficult item to&nbsp;sell (I mean, where would he even store that thing?), but it would be amazing. We know that they actually built it. They constructed the massive boat to film in and to get some great perspective shots, but what happened to it after the filming wrapped up? Crowe does have that enormous farm in Australia, so he could house it there if he needed to. Why didn't he buy it and then use it as a bandstand when he throws his outdoor parties? Ahh, the things we would do if we were rich and famous just like Russel Crowe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wish-the-cast-from-nice-guys><strong>WISH: The Cast From Nice Guys</strong></h2><p>No, we don’t mean we wish Crowe was selling the cast of the film&nbsp;The Nice Guys, as in Ryan Gosling, Angourie Rice, Kim Basinger, and Matt Bomer (although that would be interesting, wouldn't it?). What we mean is that we wish he was selling the cast that Ryan Gosling wore in the film. The cast, which Gosling wore through much of the film, took on a character of its own. Throughout filming, the little girl, Rice, even drew a baby goose on the cast, which is, of course, called a gosling. The Nice Guys was such a great movie, and if we were to own one prop from that film, it would definitely be that plaster cast.</p><p>Sources: Sothebys</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpYGLBqbXNoKpmqqWowKa4y2aaq6enmnqqv4ysnKWkmaO0brXNZp%2Biq12Ztre70ZycZpmlmMGqu81mmKecXWp6uLGMsKCsoF2dsm7Dzq6jnWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
