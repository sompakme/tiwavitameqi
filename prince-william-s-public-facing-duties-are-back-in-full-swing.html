It’s an immense responsibility.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>William and Kate, 42, are trying to navigate a new normal since her diagnosis and have made sure to celebrate their life milestones, including son Prince Louis’ <a href=#>6th birthday</a>, and their recent <a href=#>wedding anniversary</a>.
