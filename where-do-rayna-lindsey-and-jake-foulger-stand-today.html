While they've managed to get over their momentary tiff, it seems as if issues are arising between deckhands, Reyna Lindsey and Jake Foulger, who also happen to be in a showmance, or should we say...boatmance!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two hit it off early on in the season, and it didn't take much time before Rayna and Jake were locking lips. Despite having a boy back home, Rayna let her guard down and had a little fun, a decision she might be regretting now! Luckily, <a href=#>Captain Lee</a> is running a tight ship, so there are definitely no mishaps happening on his watch when it comes to their love fest.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Below Deck': What Happened Between Rachel Hargrove And Eddie Lucas?</a></span></p><p>Well, it seems as if Jake may have just dropped a major bomb on Rayna, revealing that he's actually engaged! Say what? This took the deckhand totally by surprise, which isn't helping their already growing drama. So, where do the two stand today? Let's find out! Help me.</p><h2 id=rayna-and-jake-kiss-during-first-charter>Rayna And Jake Kiss During First Charter</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the season first started out, it appeared as if the Below Deck cast would keep things strictly professional, or so we thought! It didn't take much time before deckhands, Rayna Lindsey and Jake Foulger found themselves flirting non-stop during the first charter. Well, they didn't waste any time before giving in to their feelings, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">finding themselves locking lips</a> after a steamy night in the hot tub.</p><p>Jake and Rayna continued their flirty ways for most of the first charter, however, Lindsey later revealed that she was already talking to someone from Canada. While it was clear they were in it for just the fun, things took a turn when Jake was named lead deckhand, putting their intimate moments to rest, or did it?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Below Deck': What Have Paula And Bobby Been Up To Since Their Breakup?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-jake-39-s-becoming-lead-deckhand-go-to-his-head>Did Jake's Becoming Lead Deckhand Go To His Head?</h2><p>After first officer, Eddie Lucas had a chat with Captain Lee Rosbach regarding who would stand in as the My Seanna lead deckhand, Eddie felt as if Jake Foulger was the best fit for the role. After the first charter, Captain Lee saw just how much Jake stood out, giving Eddie the green light to give his deckhand the promotion.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jake eagerly accepted the position</a> and didn't hesitate to step into his leadership role. Well, considering Rayna was not only his boatmance buddy, but now his junior, it appears as if Jake and Rayan were mixing business with pleasure. Uh-oh!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were quick to chime in, claiming that things between Rayna and Jake aren't going to end well, especially after their feud in tonight's episode. After Jake told Rayna she wasn't "pulling her weight," Lindsey lost it on Jake, and to be fair...rightfully so! Rayna called out Jake for letting the promotion get to his head, and even he admitted that he has a tough time turning off boss mode.</p><h2 id=rayna-and-jake-are-besties-today>Rayna And Jake Are Besties Today</h2><p>At the end of the episode, Jake revealed to Rayna and Fraser that he's actually engaged! Uh, come again, Jake. What was that? Yep! He's engaged. While he told Rayna she "doesn't know the full story," it's evident that kissing her was not the right move.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite their messy ways, it seems as if Rayna and Jake are doing just fine today! The deckhand admitted that Jake was the first person she hit it off with on the boat, and luckily for the two, they are still friends. Not only is their relationship great, but Rayna recently wishes Jake a happy birthday on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her Instagram</a>, referring to him as her "best friend," proving that they are better than ever!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Does Kate Chastain Really Think Of The Rest Of The 'Below Deck' Crew?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnqSfrHqlscKkZKuZqaOubrjIp5usnalit6K3xGadqK2cnLKzecqiqqxlp52ys7GMmqmeZaSdsrp5zaiuaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
