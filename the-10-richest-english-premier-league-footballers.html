In the EPL, long-standing, heated rivalries and - less common - traditional comraderies between teams makes this league one of the most talked-about in Britain. Manchester City came into the season as defending champions, but 19 other clubs are looking to take that title away. Chelsea and Swansea City are already off to a hot start, but the season has really just begun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many great players have left the league, such as Ashley Cole of the Italian club Roma, and many other greats have signed new contracts. Rio Ferdinand moved from Manchester United after 12 years to join Queens Park Rangers, and Frank Lampard left Chelsea after 13 years to join New York City FC and Manchester City. Despite a few changes, the intensity and passion for the EPL remains just as powerful as ever for millions of screaming fans.</p><p>Being the most-watched football league in the world - with a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people - it’s no wonder that the players in the Premier League make huge amounts of money.

Here, we've taken a look at just how&nbsp;much money there is to be made, with a list&nbsp;of the 10 wealthiest English-born EPL footballers in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-james-milner---9-million><strong>10.
