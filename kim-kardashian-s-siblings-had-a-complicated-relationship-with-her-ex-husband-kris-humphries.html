After all, <a href=#>Ye and Kim Kardashian had kids together</a> and there is a lot of interest in their <a href=#>net worth following their divorce</a>.</p><p>However, as any true Kardashian fan will already know, Kim Kardashian was briefly married to Kris Humphries first. During their brief marriage, many Kardashian fans didn't think Humphries was right for Kim. As it turns out, they weren't the only ones, as Kim Kardashian's siblings have spoken out against Humphries too.</p><h2 id=the-kardashian-siblings-39-true-feelings-about-kim-kardashian-39-s-ex-husband-kris-humphries>The Kardashian Siblings' True Feelings About Kim Kardashian's Ex-Husband Kris Humphries</h2><p>Throughout the Kardashian-Jenner family's time in the spotlight, the media and fans have obsessed over every detail of their lives. Since there have been so many headlines about the family, it can be hard for any of them to stand out. Despite that, the coverage of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries' incredibly short marriage has somehow remained fascinating for fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar50572900.png><p>On the other hand, it seems very clear that two of Kim Kardashian's siblings would love to forget everything about Kris Humphries. After all, two of Kim Kardashian's sisters have been critical of Humphries in the media.</p><p>In 2013, Kourtney Kardashian and Kim Kardashian appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman. During the resulting conversation, Kim Kardashian's marriage to Humphries came up with the talk show host asking if their relationship was a "fraud".</p><p>In response, Kourtney Kardashian came to her sister's defense in a way that was both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hilarious and incredibly insulting to Humphries</a>.</p><p>"I think if she was going to do it for publicity, she’d pick someone that people knew."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/does-caitlyn-jenner-get-along-with-her-children-today-or-are-they-still-not-talking-after-years-of-conflict_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Is Caitlyn Jenner Devastated By Her Relationships With Her Children?">Is Caitlyn Jenner Devastated By Her Relationships With Her Children?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Caitlyn Jenner's once close relationship with her famous daughters has gone through some very hard times amidst feuds and anger.</p><p>No matter how savage and sharp-witted Kourtney Kardashian's remark was, it pales in comparison to what Khloé Kardashian has said. During separate interviews that were years apart, Khloé Kardashian said extremely blunt things about Humphries.</p><p>One example of that came when Khloé Kardashian appeared on Snoop Dogg's web series GGN in 2016 and revealed that she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">advised her sister not to marry Humphries</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When were the Kardashian-Jenner siblings born</a>, according to USA Today?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Name:</p></th><th scope=col><p>Birthdate:</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Kourtney Kardashian</p></td><td><p>April 18, 1979</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kim Kardashian</p></td><td><p>October 21, 1980</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Khloé Kardashian</p></td><td><p>June 27, 1984</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rob Kardashian</p></td><td><p>March 17, 1987</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kendall Jenner</p></td><td><p>November 3, 1995</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kylie Jenner</p></td><td><p>August 10, 1997</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“There’s a ton of times that, like, you know, I’ve told my sister the truth.

During the resulting interview, Khloé Kardashian explained to Leno <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">why she never liked Humphries</a> after they first met.</p><p>"When I met Kris the very first time, I had just landed in New York and it was late at night … and he was in Kourtney and Kim's suite. And I went in there to say, 'Hi' because Kim was like, ‘Oh, I wanna introduce you to my friend.' They'd just started dating. And you know, one of the first things that came out of his mouth — like within the first five minutes — was, 'So, how much you getting paid to fake your marriage? Like how long are you gonna keep this up for?

In Rob Kardashian's case, for instance, he didn't take any shots at Humphries when he first spoke about his sister's divorce. In 2011, Rob Kardashian instead focused on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">offering his public support to Kim Kardashian during her divorce</a>.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What is the timeline of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries' relationship</a>, according to US Weekly?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Begin dating (October 2010)</strong></li><li><strong>Kris Humphries proposes (May 2011)</strong></li><li><strong>Their wedding day (August 2011)</strong></li><li><strong>Renewed their vows (October 2011)</strong></li><li><strong>Kim Kardashian files for divorce after 72 days (October 2011)</strong></li><li><strong>Kris Humphries files to annul the marriage (November 2011)</strong></li><li><strong>Divorce finalized (April 2013)</strong></li></ul><p>“Obviously she’s going through a lot right now, but she has her family and we’re very supportive of everything she does and every decision that she makes.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/rob-kardashian-and-kim-kardashian-together.jpg><p>Years later in 2017, Humphries commented on his former brother-in-law's relationship strife at that time.

Despite that, their memorable marriage continued to haunt Humphries so much that he penned an essay titled "I Never Wanted to Be That Guy". During that essay, Humphries wrote about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how humiliating his marriage to and divorce from Kim Kardashian was</a> for him.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/kim-kardashian-s-plastic-surgery-denial-is-legendary-but-here-s-why-she-admitted-to-getting-botox-in-her-neck.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Who Really Runs Kim Kardashian's Instagram Account?

In some cases, that has come in the form of the reality star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">defending her decision to go through with the marriage</a> at all. In 2021, Kim Kardashian explained her decision to Andy Cohen during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live.</p><p>“I thought, ‘OK. We’re filming this for a TV show. If I leave, I’m going to be known as the runway bride forever. And it’s gonna be a huge joke. And I think, ‘I have cold feet.’ So I was like, ‘OK guys, it’s just cold feet, I’ve got this.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kim-kardashian-and-kris-humphries-before-their-divorce.jpg><p>During that same interview with Cohen, Kim Kardashian reflected on how she handled her breakup with Humphries. While speaking to Cohen, Kim Kardashian fully admitted that she handled her divorce from Humphries terribly.</p><p>"But I was so nervous to break up with someone, I handled it totally the wrong way. I fully broke up with him in the worst way and I just didn’t know how to deal.”</p><p>In response to that admission, Cohen asked Kim Kardashian if she felt like she owed Humphries an apology. After Kim Kardashian stated she "absolutely" owed Humphries an apology, she claimed she tried calling him for months to offer one. Kim Kardashian also claimed that she ran into Humphries once, but he utterly refused to speak to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnqh6tLXBpaCnn6Niv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxedaiq6Flla16qcHSm5innF2gv6q%2FjKGspqiYp7amv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
