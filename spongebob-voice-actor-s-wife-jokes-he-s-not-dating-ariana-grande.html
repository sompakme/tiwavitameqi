He is not dating Ariana Grande,” Talley, 60, commented on a <a href=#>recent Instagram post</a> shared by The Cut which featured the headline, “Is Ariana Grande Dating SpongeBob Now?”</p><p>Kenny, 61, has portrayed SpongeBob SquarePants’ titular sponge on the beloved Nickelodeon animated series — as well as spin-offs The Patrick Star Show, Kamp Koral and more — since 1999. <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> confirmed on Thursday, July 20, that Grande, 30, meanwhile, is dating her <a href=#>Wicked</a> costar <a href=#><strong>Ethan Slater</strong></a>, who earned a <a href=#>2018 Tony nomination</a> for his portrayal of SpongeBob in the SpongeBob SquarePants Broadway musical.</p><p>“I don’t know if Ethan Slater (who played SpongeBob in the musical) is or isn’t dating Ariana Grande,” Talley continued. “However, they’re both adorable and I totally ship it.”</p><p>Talley — who herself has voiced Karen the computer since SpongeBob’s 1999 premiere — concluded her comment with a sweet update on her and Kenny’s marriage. “PS: as for me and Tom Kenny — we are celebrating our 27th wedding anniversary today,” she wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SpongeBob-Voice-Actor-Jokes-He-Not-Dating-Ariana-Grande-Amid-Ethan-Slater-Romance-3.jpg><p>Last week, a source told Us&nbsp;that Grande and Slater’s romance was “fairly new,” adding, “Ariana and Ethan have only recently begun seeing each other but they have a lot of fun together and are enjoying each other’s company.”</p><p>Grande’s new relationship update came days after news broke that she and her estranged husband, <a href=#><strong>Dalton Gomez</strong></a>, had <a href=#>separated after two years of marriage</a>. “Ariana and Dalton have been having some issues for months now,” a second insider told Us on July 17. “They were having issues before she left for Wicked filming [in London] that they couldn’t resolve, and the distance did not help. They haven’t been speaking and are separated, and a divorce is likely.”</p><p>Slater, 31, for his part, <a href=#>recently separated from his wife</a>, <strong>Lilly Jay</strong>. They married in 2018 and welcomed a son together in 2022.</p><p>Earlier this year, he praised his now-ex in a sweet Mother’s Day Instagram post, writing, “Happy first Mother’s Day to the most loving caring and wonderful mom/person in the world — from me and this little guy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SpongeBob-Voice-Actor-Jokes-He-Not-Dating-Ariana-Grande-Amid-Ethan-Slater-Romance-2.jpg><p>Slater <a href=#>plays Boq in the upcoming Wicked films</a> alongside Grande as Glinda the Good Witch, <a href=#><strong>Cynthia Erivo</strong></a> as Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, and <a href=#><strong>Jonathan Bailey</strong></a> as Prince Fiyero. In the stage show, Boq has an unrequited love for Glinda, who ultimately sets him up with Elphaba’s sister, Nessarose (<strong>Marissa Bode</strong>), while she pursues Fiyero.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Amid Grande’s breakup from Gomez, a third source told <a href=#>Us</a> that the Grammy winner was “determined to move forward” and that her loved ones are “happy” about her personal life progress.</p><p>Gomez, meanwhile, was “devatated” by the split. “A separation is not what he’s wanted,” another source exclusively told <a href=#>Us</a>. “He wanted the fairy tale, happy ending, and it’s not looking that way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasqJ%2BjtKauzptkr6eZmLJurcKtpqurXay2p7GMo6aknaNitaa%2FjKemrWWUlsGqusZmmKuhkaOubrPRmqWdnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
