That said, there are a few things you can do to find one that suits you sooner.</p><p>Firstly, identify what sort of notes you appreciate in a fragrance. Some of the more common notes are floral, aromatic, marine, citrus, woody, smoky, aldehydes, and aquatic.</p><p>Figure out if you’re more into bright and energizing scents like florals or those with marine notes, or perhaps you prefer warmer and rounder scents like leather, wood, smoke, or cedar.</p><p>Understanding what themes of scent you prefer will really help you to narrow down what fragrances to test out.</p><p>Don’t be afraid to ask someone what scent they’re wearing! If you’re out and someone in your friend group is smelling divine, ask them what fragrance they use. You may be able to use that knowledge to inform your own fragrance choice.</p><p>Trying a fragrance before purchasing it is also a very good idea. Fragrances are made to smell a certain way, but that scent inevitably changes when you spray it on. The fragrance interacts with the oils on your skin, which are unique to you, and changes a little or a lot.</p><p>Testing a fragrance on yourself is vital due to the potential change in smell. You can visit a large store that sells fragrances and ask for a tester, or purchase a sample-sized vial online.</p><p>Consider mixing scents as well. Mixing and matching different fragrances provides the opportunity to come up with brand new scents and combinations. You’re sure to have a bit of fun!</p><h3>How do I find a perfume that will last a long time?</h3><p>How long a fragrance lasts depends on a few things, primarily what fragrance you’re using as well as where you’re applying it.</p><p>When you use a spray-on or dab-on fragrance, the location is quite important. Warm areas, such as the neck or wrist, heat up your fragrance, causing it to evaporate and release its scent into the air. This allows the fragrance to be smelled by people around you more so than if it were on a cooler part of your body.</p><p>Areas of your body that get a lot of movement also help to release the fragrance. Putting a spray of a perfume on your shirt collar will allow it to rub up against your neck, helping to release the scent into the air.</p><p>While both of these scenarios cause the scent to be released, allowing people to smell it, they also shorten the amount of time that your fragrance will last. It’s a bit of a balancing act that you’ll have to figure out.</p><p>Applying skincare products, like moisturizers or sunscreen, will also significantly affect how long your fragrance lasts. Most perfumers recommend applying a fragrance to bare skin before any skincare products are used. This allows the fragrance to stick to your skin, extending its lifespan.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6OyuL%2BOm5ysrF2lsrOy1KacrGWWpL9uucSnZK2gkal6ra3SrWSlp56cfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
