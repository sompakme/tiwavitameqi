Heres How It Compa</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Starring in the hit <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a> series <a href=#><strong>Stranger Things</strong></a> was a great career decision for Millie Bobby Brown. Over 4 seasons, she showed the world her amazing talent through her portrayal of the endearing and cute Eleven. She then proved her power as a movie star with Netflix's Enola Holmes movies. Stranger Things fans are excited about the last season... and upset about the fact that the show is ending soon. And the actress is growing up fast. She got engaged to Jon Bon Jovi in April 2023 and continues to think about the next part of her career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After launching her <a href=#>beauty line Florence By Mills</a>, Millie Bobby Brown shared that she was coming out with a coffee line as well. How much money has Brown earned from this business idea? And how much money has she made from Stranger Things?</p><h2 id=how-much-does-millie-bobby-brown-make-from-her-coffee-line-florence-by-mills>How Much Does Millie Bobby Brown Make From Her Coffee Line Florence By Mills?</h2><p>Is Millie Bobby Brown making a ton of money from her Florence By Mills coffee? Although exact numbers aren't known, it's easy to guess that she is doing this in order to add to her net worth.</p><p>According to Daily Coffee News, Brown said in an official statement, “I’ve been passionate about coffee ever since I can remember. It’s always been that pick-me-up to get me through those long days on set, it’s that moment away from all the chaos that allows me to be present again."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/millie-bobby-brown.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brown continued, "I set out to create a brand that will allow my fans and all coffee lovers to do the same, a brand that isn’t just about great tasting coffee, but about those special moments, too. I’m delighted to finally share florence by mills coffee with you, and I hope you love it just as much as I do.”</p><p>Of course, most of Millie Bobby Brown's $14 million net worth comes from her acting projects. But she has also made money from her beauty company, Florence By Mills. While it's unknown how much Brown earned from her beauty brand, the company seems to be a success. And she must be making enough money that she feels confident about entering the coffee market.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Millie Bobby Brown's Awkward Interview Is Just The Beginning Of Her Being Rude In Public</a></span></p><p>There are definitely some start-up costs involved with starting a company. Brown isn't doing this alone, however.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Daily Coffee News reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brown is working with two companies</a>: Collab Coffee and IMG. DCN describes Collab Coffee as a company about "product development and distribution" and IMG as an "international brand licensing corporation." It's unclear if these companies paid Brown an upfront salary. Or perhaps she will earn money once customers begin purchasing the coffee products. Either way, the actress will likely make a lot of money from this product line.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/millie-bobby-brown-smiling.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The branding on Millie Bobby Brown's Florence By Mills coffee line is adorable. The packages are light purple, which adds to the brand's overall sunny and calm vibe. And fans can choose from "Authentically Brews Coffee" or "Mindful Moments Coffee." Customers can also purchase a box of three flavored syrups, including Honeycomb, Crème Brûlée and English Toffee.</p><p>The promo copy is poetic and fun. The copy on the main page of the website reads, "sweet coffee blends to bring your dreams from duvet to daylight." Fans can also find recipes for smoothies and lattes using the products.</p><p>There is also an active Instagram account for the Florence By Mills coffee brand. It has over 150,000 followers and features pretty photos of coffee and lattes on soft backgrounds.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Millie Bobby Brown Was On A Handful Of Hit Shows Before Getting Her Big Break</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It makes sense that Brown would want to create her own brand and have different streams of income. She has been promoting other companies on Instagram for a little while now. In early March 2023, Brown shared a sponsored post for Essentia Water. In 2023 and 2022, however, Brown's Instagram has been all about her skincare and beauty products. It seems like she will devote more of her Instagram feed to promoting her coffee line now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/millie-bobby-brown-waving.jpg><p>Besides launching her Florence By Mills coffee line, Millie Bobby Brown is also publishing a novel called Nineteen Steps in September 2023. She definitely has a lot to look forward to. And she continues to find ways to express her creativity.</p><h2 id=how-much-has-millie-bobby-brown-made-from-stranger-things>How Much Has Millie Bobby Brown Made From Stranger Things?</h2><p>While it seems likely that Millie Bobby Brown will earn a lot of money from her Florence By Mills coffee brand, it might not compare to her Stranger Things salary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Millie-Bobby-Brown-in-Stranger-Things-via-Entertainment-Weekly.jpg><p>Brown has been steadily making more and more money from Stranger Things. According to Celebrity Net Worth, she earned $10,000 for every season 1 episode. That increased to $30,000 for every season 2 episode. In season 3, she made $300,000 for each episode. But it's likely that her season 5 salary will be the highest.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Is An Intimacy Coordinator And Why Did One Criticize Millie Bobbie Brown?</a></span></p><p>In January 2023, IndieWire reported that David Harbour and Winona Ryder will earn $9.5 million from season 5 of Stranger Things.

She said, "I'm definitely ready to wrap up. I feel like there's a lot of the story that's been told now, and we know of it, it's been in our lives for a very long time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brown continued in her interview with Seventeen that she is fine with the fact that she will no longer play Eleven. She seems really excited about the future of her career. Brown said, "But I'm very ready to say goodbye to this chapter of my life and open new ones up. I'm able to create stories myself that are important to me and focus on the bigger picture. But I'm really grateful [for the show]."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydpp6rXaK2rbjInmSbp5KXxm6u0aiup2WdlrimecWrpqZllqG8s7HNnJxmmqliuqq4y6xknKeWm7KmecKopKmZopqxbr%2FTq5inn5WnerW0yKeerGWjlrmivtho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
