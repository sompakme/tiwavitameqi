Actress Mayim Bialik is one of them, since she actually has a PhD in neuroscience from the University of Southern California.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, when it comes to education, there is nothing better (according to some) than the Ivy League - these American universities are the best of the best, and a surprising number of famous faces attended their hallowed halls.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 People Who Became Millionaires Before Finishing High School</a></span></p><h2 id=mindy-kaling>Mindy Kaling</h2><p>Actress Mindy Kaling graduated from Dartmouth College back in 2001. The A Wrinkle In Time star originally wanted to major in Classics with a focus on Latin. But that’s not exactly how her story played out, since she ended up earning a degree in playwriting.</p><p>Kaling actually accomplished a lot during her days in school. The movie star wrote for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern</a>, and she was also a part of an improvisational group. Kaling also sang for “The Rockapellas.” The star even created a great comic strip for her school’s campus newspaper. Kaling is a woman of many talents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=natalie-portman>Natalie Portman</h2><p>Actress Natalie Portman used to be a student at Harvard University, which is where she graduated from in 2003. Though she walked away with a bachelor’s degree in psychology, the actress’s collegiate career did not stop there.</p><p>Portman continued her educational journey when she enrolled in graduate school at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I’d rather be smart than a movie star</a>,” said Portman. Portman has obviously had a very successful film career, but clearly she would be just fine even if she did not. She chose to stay home and study for her final exams over attending the premiere of Star Wars: Episode 1 when she was still in high school.</p><h2 id=lupita-nyong-o>Lupita Nyong’o</h2><p>Actress Lupita Nyong’o has accomplished some really great things, and one of them was earning her master’s degree in acting. Nyong’o attended the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yale School of Drama</a>, which is something that would look quite lovely on anyone’s resumé.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She obviously learned some very valuable things while she was a student at that school. The actress started working on major projects right after she got out of school. She played a role in 12 Years A Slave, which got her a lot of attention from film fans everywhere. Her work in that movie was so great that she received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.</p><h2 id=allison-williams>Allison Williams</h2><p>Get Out star Allison Williams grew up in Connecticut, and she went to school at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yale University</a>. Even though she waited until she graduated before she started acting professionally, Williams did try to audition for some plays while she was still a college student.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Wrestlers Who Shockingly Dropped Out Of School</a></span></p><p>She auditioned to be in one of their musicals, but she did not get a role. But Williams obviously did not stop pursuing her dream of becoming an actress, since she does it professionally these days. While Williams was a student, she was a member of an improvisational comedy group, much like some other famous faces everyone loves these days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashley-judd>Ashley Judd</h2><p>A couple of years ago, actress Ashley Judd decided to enroll herself in University of California, Berkeley so that she could earn a PhD. The actress did this because she wanted to make the world a better place, and she thought that earning this kind of degree would be a great place for her to start.</p><p>But college is not easy, even for those who are rich and famous. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sometimes I’m really excited, sometimes I’m like ‘What have I gotten myself into?!</a>” said Judd. This shouldn’t too surprising, since the actress also went to the University of Kentucky, as well as Harvard University.</p><h2 id=mira-sorvino>Mira Sorvino</h2><p>Romy And Michelle’s High School Reunion star Mira Sorvino went to Harvard University. While she was there, Sorvino studied East Asian Studies.</p><p>When her time at that college was over, the actress graduated magna cum laude. The actress certainly left her mark on Harvard, since she was one of the people who created a co-ed acapella group called the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress did not seriously pursue a career in film until after she graduated from college. Sorvino has always worked hard to achieve her dreams, whether they had anything to do with college or not. She was hired to work on the film Amongst Friends as an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">assistant director</a>, but eventually got the lead role.</p><h2 id=rashida-jones>Rashida Jones</h2><p>After she graduated high school, actress Rashida Jones enrolled herself in Harvard University. The actress originally planned to graduate with a degree in law, but that’s not how things worked out for her.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 High School Musical Stars: Where Are They Now?</a></span></p><p>Instead, Jones found herself becoming interested in the world of show business while she was in school. The actress took part in a lot of fun things, including a drama club. Like many other stars in Hollywood, she became a member of an acapella singing group.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jones’s career did not get off to the best start. Before she landed a role on the American version of The Office, she was seriously considering giving up her dreams of acting.</p><h2 id=jodie-foster>Jodie Foster</h2><p>Actress Jodie Foster is very smart, and she got a great education at Yale University. Though the actress did spend a lot of time around people that were in show business when she was growing up, she also had some other interests as well.</p><p>While Foster was a college student, she studied literature, which is what she eventually got a degree in when she graduated magna cum laude in 1985. In the late 1990s, the movie star was honored by the university when they gave her a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Doctor of Fine Arts degree</a>. Foster is a very impressive woman who has over 50 films on her resumé.</p><h2 id=david-duchovny>David Duchovny</h2><p>Actor David Duchovny originally wanted to be a writer, and that is why he attended Yale University. The movie star wanted to write poems, but after discovering that he wasn’t meant to do that, he decided to write fictional stories.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After discovering that he didn’t really have any ideas to write about, the actor decided that trying theatre might be good idea. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I thought,</a> ‘Well, if I’m going to write about things that are gonna be performed by actors, then it’s probably helpful for me to know something about what that’s like,” said Duchovny. Eventually, his acting career took off.</p><h2 id=elizabeth-banks>Elizabeth Banks</h2><p>Actress Elizabeth Banks graduated magna cum laude in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1996</a> from the University of Pennsylvania before her acting career took off. Banks studied communication and theatre, and those two things helped her a lot later on in her life.</p><p>After she finished attending that school, the actress went to the American Conservatory Theater, and she got a master’s degree in fine arts. Since then, the actress has seen a lot of success, and she is actually considered to be the sixth highest-grossing actress of all time. The actress definitely has a great head on her shoulders.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Of The Most Shocking Prep School Scandals</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nnaTDqrGMrKuaqqNisKa4xJupoqypYra3xYylnJqfpZp6tK%2FHqKalZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
