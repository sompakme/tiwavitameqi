She noted that most of the book’s stories were “from 20 years ago” and she has “moved on” since then.</p><p>“It’s a beautiful clean slate from here!!!” Spears added. “I am here to establish it that way for the rest of my entire life!!! Either way, that is the last of it and s–t happens. This is actually a book I didn’t know needed to be written, although some might be offended, it has given me closure on all things for a better future.”</p><p>The book recounts her rocky familial relationships, life under the conservatorship of dad Jamie Spears and her rise to fame. The “Stronger” singer also included many revelations from her romantic relationships, including that she <a href=#>lost her virginity</a> at age 14 to a boy in her hometown and how she and<a href=#><strong> Justin Timberlake</strong></a> handled an accidental pregnancy.</p><p>Britney opened up about feeling conflicted about<a href=#> having an abortion</a>. “But Justin definitely <a href=#>wasn’t happy</a> about the pregnancy. He said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young,” she wrote. “I’m sure people will hate me for this, but I agreed not to have the baby. I don’t know if that was the right decision. If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it. And yet Justin was so sure that he didn’t want to be a father.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Britney and Timberlake, now 42, who met in the early ’90s on the set of <a href=#>The All New Mickey Mouse Club</a>, started dating in 1999 but ultimately split in 2002 over reports of infidelity. The Woman In Me alleges that <a href=#>both were unfaithful</a>. Spears wrote that Timberlake eventually broke up with her <a href=#>via text message</a>, which left her feeling “clinically in shock” and “devastated.”</p><p>Reporting by Travis Cronin</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpmpu6bFjKynnpmiqHqqv4yer5yhpJqxbq3BqKytZaSdsm61w56YZqeWYsSztdOipaBlkWJ%2Fr7CMm6aoo18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
