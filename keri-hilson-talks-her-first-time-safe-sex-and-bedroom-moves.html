Her first hit single “Energy” offered a complementary visual of the singer/songwriter glistening in sweat and boxing gear, while her sultry follow-up made sure all the fellows came correct in “Turnin’ Me On.”<span id=more-170145></span></p><p>But before the 30-year-old songstress, who is also signed as a Wilhelmina model, grew into her pretty girl swag, she admits that her first time was nerve-wracking. “My first time terrified me. I was very, very, very scared. I wore a promise ring, it was called “true love waits,” and [me and my boyfriend] took this oath at church with the youth group, so I wore that rings for years and years before I even took that step in college,” she explains. “I cried … but it was safe.”</p><p>Making sure to practice <a href=# id=auto-tag_safe-sex_2 data-tag=safe-sex>safe sex</a> still stays at the top of her to-do list, especially given her relationship with hunky basketball star Serge Ibaka. Keri stresses the importance of getting tested, especially since many individuals are usually unaware that they’re carrying HIV. “People that are scared to know their results, whether you go to the doctor’s office or [do] the <a href=# rel=nofollow>OraQuick at-home test</a>, which is the first of its kind, you should have someone around that supports you.”</p><p>When it comes to her philosophy in the bedroom, however, she references her steamy mandate in Trey Song’z “Invented Sex” remix. “In the song ‘I Invented Sex,’ the remix I did with Trey Songz, missionary is quite boring,” she says. “It’s not on its way out, it’s actually a lot of peoples favorite position I’m sure, but you know sex can be a little more creative.”</p><p>Miss Keri baby also offers some slow jams perfect for after-hour play.
