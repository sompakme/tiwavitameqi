But she didn’t just strip down: the 30-year old singer-songwriter also wore at least 14 looks in the short released on Sunday, October 2, co directed by her husband, <b>Alan Ferguson</b>.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/solange-6b60c904-c184-4964-9c9b-cfc9940c29c9.jpg alt=Solange width=1000 height=530 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>In the clip, Solange poses in an assortment of outfits that weren’t necessarily composed of fabric. One shot showed the “Losing You” musician in a minidress made of large green leaves. And in another, she modeled a dress made up of pink plastic. This look isn’t too much of a surprise — in June, she Instagrammed a short video of herself dancing in a gown made of dry cleaning bags!&nbsp;</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/solange-2-1940ec77-ce1a-489a-a220-c7920e404a6b.jpg alt=Solange width=1000 height=518 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>And of course, Solange’s mom, Ms. <b>Tina Knowles</b>, also had a role in the project. In just two days, the former Destiny’s Child costume designer created a set of purple Issey Miyake–inspired frocks with material in between them, connecting Solange to six of her friends, as seen in the video.&nbsp;</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/solange-4-754d3522-c2d6-4672-8024-3c51dcbe00be.jpg alt=Solange width=1000 height=503 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>If clothes were the focus of “Cranes In the Sky,” then her strands took center stage for the “Don’t Touch My Hair” video, also released on October 2. In this clip — an anthem of black female empowerment — Solange dons an assortment of styles including a headful of beaded plaits inspired by R&B singer <b>Patrice Rushen</b> and a short, cropped wig with face-framing finger waves.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/solange-1-b007fa0e-875c-4675-8569-d65e29561e65.jpg alt=Solange width=1000 height=533 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>In an interview with <i><a href=#>The Fader</a></i>, Solange addressed some of the comparisons to her sister <b>Beyonce</b>’s <i>Lemonade</i> project from earlier this year. Solange and her older sister’s respective albums are both seen as odes to black womanhood and the Black Lives Matter movement. “We have the same mother and the same father. We grew up in the same household, and so we had and heard the same conversations,” she noted. “It shouldn’t be surprising that two people who grew up in the same household with the same parents who are very, very aware — just like everyone else is — of all of the inequalities and the pain and suffering of our people right now, would create art that reflects that.”</p><p></p><p>Beyonce praised her baby sister for that creation in a September 30 Instagram post. “Congrats to my sister on creating this beautiful work of art. I could not be more proud of you @saintrecords. A Seat At The Table is available today!” she wrote.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p><a href=#>Stylish by Us Weekly</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6i8ra3NoJxmn5%2BawG66wKScnWWWpL9ur9GapZ6rXZ67bsDHnmSso6liura%2FyJxkr6GUmrxuw5NtamlsaWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
