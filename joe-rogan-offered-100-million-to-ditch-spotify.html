The podcast has a bigger audience than the highest-rated programs on more mainstream media outlets like Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC.</p><p>Rogan has recently come under fire for spreading COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and using racial slurs. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek apologized to staffers in a memo and condemned Rogan’s remarks but said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“canceling voices is a slippery slope.”</a></p><p>The backlash has led to a slew of artists pulling their music from Spotify, including Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Nils Lofgren, Graham Nash, India Arie, David Crosby, and Stephen Stills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ek said that he spoke to Rogan and his team about his “history of using some racially insensitive language," and that Rogan decided to remove over 100 past episodes from the streaming platform. Ek has steadfastly argued that silencing Rogan isn’t the correct answer to the backlash, saying that one of the company’s core values is having an open platform.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The Joe Rogan Experience: 8 Ways Joe Rogan Earns And Spends His Millions</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hill</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3sLGMq6agmZ5ivKeyxKucnWVhZX1uucilo6KnnmLBsHnDoqucoF2ovbDAyJ%2BwaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
