The 37-year-old influencer <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pled guilty</a> to one count of money laundering in a California Court in April. Hushpuppi attempted to steal more than <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$1.1m</a> from an unnamed individual who wanted to fund a new children's school in Qatar. But this is just one of many schemes from Hushpuppi's decade-long <a href=#>criminal spree</a>, reportedly costing victims an estimated <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$24m (Â£17m)</a>. With multiple victims targeted across the globe, Hushpuppi's court records indicate that the social media influencer could be facing <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">up to 20 years</a> in prison and will need to 'pay full restitution to the victims'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hushpuppi showcased his flashy lifestyle through <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, posing with cars, clothes, sneakers, and suits, flexing his wealth and wallet for his followers on a weekly basis. But shortly after posing in front of his new <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolls-Royce Wraith</a>, Hushpuppi switched his bio from 'Billionaire Gucci Master' to 'Real Estate Developer' in a subtle attempt to legitimize his enterprise. Meanwhile, Kristi Johnson, acting director of the FBI's Los Angeles office, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> Hushpuppi was one of the 'most high-profile money launderers in the world'. So how did a clout-chasing fleecer go from viral star to downward spiral? The answer lies in sloppy transactions, a heist that went wrong, and ultimately, greed, which caused this influencer to think more about what went on his grid than his inevitable repercussions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=yahoo-boys>Yahoo Boys</h2><p>Abbas started his career in international crime while living in the northeast region of Lagos. His father was a cab driver, and his mother sold bread while Abbas started his career as a car washer before diving deep into a life of cyber-crime. In the early days of Yahoo email addresses, Abbas <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">created fake accounts</a> under a variety of names and would solicit funds from unsuspecting victims. Abbas would pose as a stranded soldier from America, strapped for cash and stuck in Africa, looking for a way home. Other times, he would pose as <a href=#>an eligible bachelor</a>, entering into online relationships with women, asking for money as their relationship developed. Abbas and a group of other individuals began referring to themselves as the "<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo boys</a>" due to their successful email schemes. After several swindles, the group migrated from Lagos to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</a>, where the scams got more elaborate, and the money continued to accumulate. During his time in Malaysia, Abbas emerged as <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the ringleader</a> of the group of scammers and started self-identifying as a billionaire. This eventually led to a move to the United Arab Emirates, where Abbas continued to showcase his wealth through social media posts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Unbelievable Heists That Were Easily Pulled Off</a></span></p><h2 id=dubai-bye>Dubai-Bye</h2><p>Once in Dubai, Abbas' wealth grew exponentially. Now known under the moniker "Hushpuppi," Abbas started <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posting pictures</a> in Ferraris, Maybachs, and Bentleys. He <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ordered crates of champagne</a> to nightclubs, shared photos sporting <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$150,000 watches </a>adorned with diamonds, and stated his designer luggage traveled in its own Rolls-Royce. But these flexes of wealth required more ambitious schemes to keep the funds coming, the most popular being his "Business Email Compromises." The simple scheme involved creating email addresses only slightly different from their original senders. They would then mimic the emails of law firms and <a href=#>other businesses</a> known for their wire transfers, send notices to expecting clients, and intercept the funds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But as Hushpuppi began flexing more wealth on social media, his anonymity started to slip. He let slide <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his birthday on one post</a>, which allowed the FBI and Interpol to determine his date of birth and link Hushpuppi to a recent visa application for a Dubai resident. When the SWAT team pulled into the Palazzo Versace in Dubai to arrest him, they found <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$40 million</a> in cash, 13 automobiles with a collected worth of <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$6.8 million</a>, along with 47 smartphones that were used throughout his cyber crimes. Hushpuppi and his crew were accused of running scams that netted a reported <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$456 million</a> altogether.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-scale-of-the-schemes>The Scale Of The Schemes</h2><p>After his arrest, additional crimes and email schemes started to emerge. One of them involved Abbas <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">working with North Korean hackers</a> to launder funds taken digitally from a Maltese bank. The heist occurred in February of 2019 and has been referred to by the Justice Department as "a <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$14.7 million</a> cyber-heist from a foreign financial institution." The Justice Department has also stated in another indictment that the partnership between Abbas and the North Korean military hackers may have resulted in the extortion of more than <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$1.3 billion</a> in both fiat&nbsp;<a href=#>money and cryptocurrency</a>. Another scheme during the Business Email Compromise (BEC) phase of Hushpuppi's career involved a Premier League Football Club. Abbas attempted to set up a bank account in Mexico that would <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">intercept payments</a> from a private firm to the undisclosed football club. The technique was one Abbas perfected, changing email addresses by just a few key letters that caused confusion when it came time to send payments. The case of the football club resulted in nearly <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$100 million</a> in payouts. BEC scams are most common in Nigeria, where the county operates nearly <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50% of all confirmed scams</a>. BEC and similar scams account for the majority of reported cybercrime losses in 2020, netting nearly <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$1.95 billion</a> in total losses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=phoning-it-in>Phoning It In</h2><p>While social media, Instagram, and smartphones ultimately brought fame to Hushpuppi, giving him <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">millions of followers</a>, it also became the source of his downfall. Abbas often used his main cell phone in Dubai to send incriminating texts to collaborators and other individuals involved. Several text messages were sent between Hushpuppi and Ghaleb Alaumary, his partner, in several BEC scams. The text messages serve as the basis for most of the criminal charges against Hushpuppi. While Abbas remains in Los Angeles waiting to be charged for his cyber-crimes, Alaumary has already <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pled guilty</a> to money laundering charges. Throwing Abbas under the bus, Alaumary named Hushpuppi as a conspirator in the law firm BEC scams, the Malta bank heist, and <a href=#>the Premier League</a> scam. Abbas has now split from his attorney, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">citing</a> 'irreconcilable disagreements regarding the theory of defense' replacing him with another L.A.-based attorney. Two days before his arrest, Hushpuppi took to Instagram and chose to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">share a photo</a> of a Rolls Royce with the caption: "May success and prosperity not be a 'once upon a time' story in your life...Thank you, Lord, for the many blessings in my life, continue to shame those waiting for me to be shamed." As of September 2021, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram has stated</a> Hushpuppi can continue using his account. But as the criminal charges keep piling up and a stipulation to "pay full restitution to the victims," Hushpuppi may have to substitute his uber-wealthy content for more modest images. Will his followers drop off? Or will he reinvent himself as the legitimate influencer and social media star he has already pretended to be?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Dramatic Bank Heists Caught On Camera</a></span></p><p>Source: <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GreekReporter</a>, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NYPost</a>, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheGuardian</a>, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheNational</a>, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PunchNG</a>, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DubaiLAD</a>, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheSun</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSvqrjLoqanmZmnsm6z1JyaomWdlsC1sdFmoKermZmybrXNn6OunZ6YsrN5x66qoailpb2qv4ymoKWkmaS7brDOpaOaql2dsqq%2F02g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
