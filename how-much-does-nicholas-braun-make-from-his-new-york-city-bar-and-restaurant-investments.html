Several <a href=#>celebrities own gourmet restaurants and some even have Michelin stars</a>. However, for Nicholas Braun, his business venture into New York's vibrant culinary scene is more of a childhood dream.</p><p>Although he played the underdog as <a href=#>Cousin Greg in HBO's Succession in all four seasons</a>, Braun in real life backs his words with actions.

Braun has invested in four culinary establishments in New York City. The first bar, Downstairs at Ray's is situated just beneath the original bar and exudes a speakeasy vibe.

"It's hard to find a place where you're not screaming over other people, or it's so loud that you can't even have a conversation—where you're just sort of looking at people, wishing you could talk to them."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Braun's Pebble Bar, which opened in 2022, is an establishment spanning three stories of a townhouse in New York City, formerly the location of Hurley's.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The space has been transformed into an intimate, stylish setting and is supported by his fellow restaurateurs</a> Noah Bernamoff, Carlos Quirarte, Matt Kliegman, Julian Brizzi, Matthew Charles, and SNL's Pete Davidson.</p><p>Drawing inspiration from Ray's, Braun intends to infuse the Pebble Bar vision with lessons learned.</p><p>"Ray's is such a different vibe. Who knows, though, it could get pretty raucous in here… You think you’re going to go in for one drink, and you spend the whole night there. There’s something transportive about it. I hope that's what this becomes."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Nicholas Braun Really Feels About His Most Famous Scene In 'Succession'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Braun collaborated with Authentic Hospitality in his new Manhattan bar, Jac's on Bond.
