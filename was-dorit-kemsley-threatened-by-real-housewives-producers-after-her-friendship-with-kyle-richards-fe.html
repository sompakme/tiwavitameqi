With Kemsley’s lack of storylines and insincerity around her marriage, it’s rumored Kemsley was almost demoted.

Fans saw the couple meet with marriage counselors to figure out their issues. And while Kemsley told Andy Cohen that her marriage was “stronger than ever,” the reality was different.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Kyle-Richards--(2).jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Does Kyle Richards' Insane Net Worth Come From The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills Or Real Estate?">Does Kyle Richards' Insane Net Worth Come From The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills Or Real Estate?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>There's no doubt that Kyle Richards lives a very comfortable life, and fans are curious about where the source of her wealth actually comes from.</p><p>The Daily Mail reported that after months of living apart when PK was in London, he temporarily <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">moved into the Beverly Hills Hotel</a> amid marital issues.

When Richards had ongoing issues with her older sister Kathy Hilton, she was upset that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Kemsley didn't support her</a> — especially at the Season 12 reunion, as reported by E! Online.

Things came to a head when the Housewives traveled to Aspen for a getaway. E! Online shared that when the women were out for the night, Hilton and Richards got into a screaming match, which altered the future of their relationship. At the reunion, Richards felt defeated by her sister and looked to Kemsley for support. Instead, Kemsley stayed out of it. "I have a relationship with Kathy, which was independent of my relationship with you. I didn't want to get in the middle," Kemsley said to Richards. <strong>Richards was disappointed in Kemsley</strong> since they were far closer than Kemsley was with Hilton.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Kyle Claimed Dorit 'Exaggerated' Their Friendship</strong></p></td><td><p>Over the years, Richards and Kemsley have joined forces with other Housewives Lisa Rinna and Erika Jayne as an alliance against the other Housewives. As time went on, however, it appears Richards didn't see the value in their friendship the same way Kemsley did. According to Reality Blurb, Kemsley was upset that Richards didn't invite her on any of her vacations like she used to when they were close. Richards, however, fired back that they only did vacations together for the show. <strong>"Let’s not exaggerate the situation," Richards said.</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Kyle Felt Dorit's Questions About Her Marriage Were Disingenuous</strong></p></td><td><p>In Season 13, Kemsley knew things weren't great in Richards's marriage but was confused as to why Richards wasn't confiding in her. With the Bravo cameras rolling, Kemsley asked her deeper questions about her relationship and how things were going because she read breakup rumors in the tabloids. Richards didn't appreciate Kemsley's meddling and voiced her frustrations to Bravo.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Dorit Stirred The Pot Around Kyle And Morgan Wade's Friendship</strong></p></td><td><p>Kemsley continued stirring the pot in Richards' love life in Season 13 once rumors circulated that Richards was romantically linked to her new friend, country singer Morgan Wade. Instead of allowing Richards to grieve the loss of her marriage and entertain a new friendship, Kemsley instigated and fed into the narrative that Richards was now dating a woman. According to People, Richards said, "You knew that by saying something like that, it was going to create a bigger problem for me in the media with the whole Morgan situation."</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Dorit Shared A Private Text From Kyle With The Cast.</strong></p></td><td><p>One of the final nails in the coffin was when<strong> Kemsley shared a private text from Richards</strong> on the day of the Season 13 reunion. Richards texted Kemsley hoping to keep the issues they had in their friendship private. Instead, Kemsley shared the message with a few women in the cast. Kemsley felt that Richards was trying to "silence" her. Richards was shocked that Kemsley shared her private message with production, causing even more trust issues.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/dorit-kemsley-looking-at-the-camera-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>Now that Dorit Kemsley and Kyle Richards are going through public separations while in a tumultuous place in their friendship, Richards gave an update on where they stood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with US Weekly, <strong>Richards said she and Kemsley were "not great."</strong> “The dynamics have shifted tremendously this year," Richards confided.
