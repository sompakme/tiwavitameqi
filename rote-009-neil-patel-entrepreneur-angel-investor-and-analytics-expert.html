Then Neil learned the definition of hard work when he got his first job at Knott’s Berry Farm, where he was paid minimum wage to clean restrooms and pick up trash.&nbsp;After that&nbsp;Neil then learned the concept of selling, by being a door to door sales man for Kirby vacuums.</p><p>With a wide range of work experience and learning under his belt, all of this eventually led to the successful Neil Patel that many of us know today through his blog at QuickSprout.</p><p>Today Neil Patel is the co-founder of Crazy Egg, Hello Bar and KISSmetrics.
