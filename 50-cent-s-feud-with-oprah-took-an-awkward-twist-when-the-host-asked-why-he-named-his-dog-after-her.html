This might have been funny when the rapper named his pet, but when confronted by the host herself, he might have felt a little differently.

An interviewer might say something that makes their guest feel uncomfortable or angry, or a <a href=#>celebrity might be a difficult guest</a> for certain reasons, or act outrageous.</p><p>During Oprah Winfrey's interview with In da Club rapper, things got interesting when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she asked 50 Cent why he named his dog "Oprah", after her</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During their interview, after letting 50 Cent know she knew he had named his dog after her, When she first brought up the topic, Winfrey said, "I heard you have, you have a dog named Oprah," which sounded more like a statement than a question for the rap artist.</p><p>While many top celebrities might have taken offense to a pet being named for them, Oprah decided to take it as a compliment no matter how it was meant.</p><p>Grinning, 50 Cent seemed a little awkward, and agreed, "yeah." The host then commented, "I consider that to be a compliment, whether you meant it to be one or not," before bursting into laughter. After this, he turned to Oprah, telling her, "I love you!", causing her to laugh some more.</p><p>Continuing to grin, 50 Cent then commented, "You know how a dog's is man's best friend?"

However, the Many Men rapper did eventually appear on her show for an interview.</p><p>Before Oprah invited him on, 50 Cent had provoked the host, including naming his dog after Winfrey. This was something the iconic talk show host was well aware of before he appeared on her show, and Oprah couldn't help but bring it up and ask Jackson why he would name his dog after her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After their initial joking around, Oprah took control and wanted to ask the question more seriously. She said to him, "You named your dog Oprah, that was not the compliment... Why'd you name your dog Oprah?"</p><p>At this point, 50 Cent gives a candid response, explaining, "At the time, I was just looking at the situation, and I'd say I was just developing negative feelings for someone who doesn't even know me."</p><p>Continuing, he said "And then I gave it (Oprah's name) to the dog because I was excited about the dog at the time." He added, "I thought it was gonna be bigger, because, you know, it's a miniature dog, but I got the little, little one. So it's like, this big." Jackson held out his hands to demonstrate her size.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Despite Her Status, Oprah Winfrey Is Still Getting Turned Down By Comedians For Interviews</a></span></p><p>"What kind of dog is she?" Oprah asked next, apparently wanting to learn more about the dog who was named for her. "She's a schnauzer, 50 Cent replied, sounding proud of his pet." The host then commented, "So you have a miniature schnauzer named Oprah."</p><p>She then asked a bigger question, "So now do you have greater affection for me?" To this, 50 Cent responded, "Absolutely, I have for you for a few years now. I take pictures like, and say crazy stuff on Twitter, but it would impact, because it was associated with me saying it to you."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhsaWWTmru1v4yfnK6cXay2tbSMqKermZhiwbC7ymaYp2WRrLi4rdGdZK2vmajBbsPHnqVmmaOgsqV51qGwZqCVYruiucSdZKGho2KxsLOMmp2tnaJitaa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
