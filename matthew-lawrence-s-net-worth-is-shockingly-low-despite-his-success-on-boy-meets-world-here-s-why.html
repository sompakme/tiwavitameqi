For example, <a href=#>Ben Savage went into politics</a> and even <a href=#>stopped talking to his former co-stars</a>. But, in contrast to cast members like Rider Strong and Danielle Fishel who fans still follow along with today, Matthew Lawrence isn't a name that people hear about all that often now.</p><p>When compared to the other actors from the Boy Meets World cast, the actor hasn't starred in many TV shows or movies in the years since Boy Meets World. He also has a low net worth. For instance, <a href=#>Ben Savage could stop acting</a> thanks to his $8 million net worth. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Danielle Fishel has a $4 million net worth. Here's the truth about Matthew Lawrence's net worth and what he has been doing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-matthew-lawrence-39-s-net-worth>What Is Matthew Lawrence's Net Worth?</h2><p>It always seems like when an actor is cast on a hit show, they have it totally made for the rest of their life and career. They must be able to sign with any agent, manager, or publicist that they want. They probably have their choice of movie or TV roles. The world is basically their oyster.</p><p>Unfortunately, though, that doesn't happen to everyone. While Matthew Lawrence was incredibly charming and funny as Shawn Hunter's goofy older brother Jack Hunter, he didn't act as much after Boy Meets World as fans would have thought.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/matthew-lawrence-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Matthew Lawrence has a net worth of $2 million. This is surprising since when fans think about a cast member from a popular show like Boy Meets World, it's hard to imagine that they wouldn't have been paid a high salary. When Lawrence played Jack Hunter, he appeared in 68 episodes, which must be considered a pretty big part.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Rachael Leigh Cook And Rider Strong Dated In Secret After His Boy Meets World Fame, Here's The Truth About Their Relationship</a></span></p><p>While Lawrence's Boy Meets World salary is unknown, fans can guess that he might not have been paid as much as the other cast members such as Danielle Fishel, Ben Savage, Will Friedle, and Rider Strong. This could be one reason why his net worth seems a little low for such a famous actor. It's also unclear what his deal was or if he received any residuals for his time on the sitcom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lawrence also didn't get cast in any major TV roles or big movies when Boy Meets World ended. This would have affected his ability to earn a lot of money. He was in one episode of Boston Public in 2004 and CSI: Miami in 2003, but those likely wouldn't have paid him very much. From 2011 to 2014, he was in four episodes of the sitcom Melissa and Joey, but that wasn't a huge role.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/matthew-lawrence.jpg><p>In fact, fans could argue that the actor's most high-profile role since Jack Hunter on Boy Meets World is appearing on season 24 of the reality series Worst Cooks In America. Since the winner of the reality series gets $25,000 if they come out on top, it doesn't seem that any of the contestants earn a salary for their time on the show. While of course, these shows are always good exposure, they don't add up to much money in the bank for those who aren't victorious.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Cheryl Burke And Matthew Lawrence's Relationship And Divorce</a></span></p><p>While Boy Meets World fans would have expected Matthew Lawrence to star in more sitcoms after the hit show, things worked out differently.</p><h2 id=what-is-matthew-lawrence-doing-now>What Is Matthew Lawrence Doing Now?</h2><p>While Matthew Lawrence seems to still be acting here and there, his focus is also on his personal life. <a href=#>Matthew Lawrence started a relationship with Rozonda Chilli Thomas</a> in 2022 and he has given a lot of interviews about how much he wants to be a father. He has never said that acting isn't a good idea for him anymore or that he isn't staying open-minded about taking on more roles in the future. But it does seem that, as he gets older, he wants to have a family. This might be something that he is focusing on.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What We Know About Cheryl Burke's Relationship With Ex-Husband Matthew Lawrence</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In March 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lawrence talked about Chili</a> in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. He said of having kids,</p><p>“I hope. … That’s what we’re trying to do."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/are-90s-stars-matthew-lawrence-and-tlc-s-chilli-really-dating_.jpg><p>However, a little while later, Chili shared that they weren't actively attempting to conceive. According to E! News, she said, “First of all, we’re not currently trying to have a child. We’re not married yet so we’re just very happy and growing in our relationship.” Of course, it makes sense that the couple wouldn't want fans to know intimate details about their family planning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like his Boy Meets World co-star Rider Strong, who has his popular podcast Pod Meets World, Matthew Lawrence has also been devoting his time to podcasting. Lawrence and his famous actor brothers Joey Lawrence have a podcast called Brotherly Love along with their other siblings Andy and Matt. This allows fans to get to know him better and hear some interesting tidbits from his life.</p><p>Matthew Lawrence gets very deep in his podcast episodes and sometimes talks about dating. In one episode, he talked about why some of his past love stories didn't work out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/matthew-lawrence-1-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Us Weekly, he explained that he struggled to find the right balance in previous romances. He said, “It really didn’t come down to, ‘Was this a good union? Are we making each other happy? Is there trust and bonds and are there good things here?’ I was just like, ‘If I am going to do anything right, I am going to make sure this person is so darn happy with me.' It never works.”</p><p>While Matthew Lawrence didn't play any major TV characters besides Jack Hunter on Boy Meets World, he appears to have found a lot of success in his personal life. He and Chili don't show any signs of breaking up, and he might also make good money from his Brotherly Love podcast since he and his brother Joey Lawrence are such big stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqyknbK4ecuarqudnpiybrrErWSwp6KptW6uzrJkpp2VqcBuw86ro51lo5a5or7YZq6hmaRitaK8z56lnpxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
