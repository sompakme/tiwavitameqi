Dressed in a white graphic t-shirt and black pants, the video starts off with YG speaking to a crowded room. Throughout the video, photographers could be heard taking photos of the event.</p><p>YG explained his motivation behind the generous act. While addressing the crowd, rapper explained that he “<a href=#>grew up on the streets</a>,” so he wanted to find a way to make a difference amid his success. Now that he’s launched his own sneaker brand, YG said it only felt right to give back to the community.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kanye West's First Pair Of Yeezy Sneakers On Sale For $1 Million</a></span></p><p>Next, the rapper proceeded to hand out shoeboxes. “Welcome home,” he could be heard saying to the former inmates as he shook their hands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=#>Times News Express</a>, the event was held at <a href=#>Amity Foundation House</a> on Friday, located in downtown <a href=#>L.A.</a> According to the organization’s website, their L.A. location serves as a reintegration home for recently release prisoners coming from California jails. They can host upwards of 225 men at one time.</p><p>YG didn’t give away just any sneakers. Specifically, they were Block Runner sneakers. The rapper launched the footwear line this year. The first shoe in their collection is known as The Flame, and was the exact sneaker YG handed out at the event. The white high-top sneaker features a flame detailing on the side and retails for $200 USD. Buyers can only purchase them exclusively on 4Hunnid.com.</p><p>Previously, YG has explained that the sneaker was inspired by West Coast lifestyle, <a href=#>WWD</a> reports. It’s meant to resemble other popular sneakers on the market, including Nike Cortez and Puma. YG worked with designer Chris Burnett to create the shoe. In total, it took the duo three years to complete the product.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Uproxx</a> notes that YG gave away hundreds of pairs of The Flame while at Amity Foundation House. He reportedly donated $20,000 worth of sneakers. Given that the shoes cost $200 a pair, he likely gave away 100 pairs of shoes. Uproxx&nbsp;adds that the good deed came the same day YG’s joint album with Mozzy, Kommunity Service, release. Mozzy also attended the event. YG previously released his fifth solo album, My Life 4Hunnid, last year.</p><p>This isn’t the first time YG has given away his sneakers to a good cause. In March, <a href=#>TMZ</a> reported that he gave away 50 pairs of his The Flame sneaker to homeless individuals on Skid Row, which cost him upwards of $10,000. The publication adds that his shoe collection has been wildly successful so far, having sold out within seven minutes in its initial launch.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Travis Scott Teases Collaboration With Nike For Limited-Edition Sneakers</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>Amity Foundation House</a>, <a href=#>WWD</a>, <a href=#>Uproxx</a>, <a href=#>Times News Express</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2ForzPnqlmsZditKrCxKxkmq%2BRrnq0usSaop6qo2K9s7XSqKWeqqNiv6a4xJqqnpxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
