I think feet are beautiful,” he told the publication on Monday, July 13. “And I think Megan has the most beautiful feet that exist.”</p><p dir=ltr>Kelly then recalled a conversation he had with Fox about having her feet appear in the video, adding: “I was like, ‘Megan, you already know what I’m about to ask you.
