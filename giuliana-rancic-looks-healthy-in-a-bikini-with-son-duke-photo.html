The <i>Fashion Police</i> host showed off her fit frame in a black swimsuit with a matching black visor and sunglasses.</p><p>It’s been quite some time since the<i> Going Off Script</i> author has bared her body after she was criticized throughout the 2015 awards season for her rail-thin appearance, which many believed was the result of an eating disorder.</p><p>Giuliana opened up to <i>Today</i>’s <b>Savannah Guthrie</b> in April 2015 and revealed that her <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> was actually due to her cancer medication. The <i>E! News</i> star was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011. “I do not have an eating disorder. I wanted to be very clear about that,” she told Guthrie. “In fact, I eat a lot. People always love to tweet: ‘Eat a burger.’ I eat burgers. It’s not working.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/giuliana-rancic-zoom-bdeedc26-7da1-4fe6-9907-66ade9c51a14.jpg><p>The TV personality also spoke to <b>Dr. Oz</b> the same month about her struggle with skinny shaming. “Trust me, I don’t want to lose weight. I don’t think it looks attractive,” she said. “I think I used to be more attractive. But I’m doing the best I can.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She explained that she’d been hitting the gym to regain her curves but was lifting weights instead of doing cardio. “So there I am, lifting my little 10-pound weights,” she told Dr. Oz. ”I want to be sexy. And right now, it’s killing me to look in the mirror and see that I’ve just lost all [of it]. I’m just not the girl I used to be.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGagoaWhtqK6wGapmqaTnrBuuM6ooqxlmJqurcDHsmSipl2WeqO1yqKlomWnnsGpedKopWacpaCybrzHqKuoZadnfXR9lm5m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
