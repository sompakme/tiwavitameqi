We receive compensation when you click on a link and make a purchase. <a href=# rel>Learn more!</a></p><p><strong>Ariana Madix</strong> is no stranger to mixing things up — and not just cocktails!&nbsp;The Vanderpump Rules star might be the owner of a skincare company, but she has plenty of hair care tips to serve up, too.</p><p>As fans know, the 33-year-old’s boyfriend <strong>Tom Sandoval</strong> has an intense and well-documented hair regimen, but her hair is full of secrets, too. Madix’s hairstylist recently spilled that she uses <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this powder spray</a> for extra volume and to protect her tresses!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/oribe-powder.jpg><p><strong>See it: Grab the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Oribe Swept Up Volume Powder Spray</a> for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$42</a>, available at Dermstore!</strong></p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oribe Swept Up Volume Powder Spray</a> is a dry shampoo that adds volume, absorbs oil and even protects hair from damage!</p><p>Ever hear how good things come in small packages? Well, this powder spray is case in point. At first glance, beauty lovers will think that because it’s labeled a powder spray, it’s reserved exclusively to that. But trust Us, it’s so much more than that.</p><p>This powder spray can help to absorb oil, buildup and odor. With just a few spritzes at our roots, it can leave our hair looking refreshed and revived. Is everyone thinking what we’re thinking? Since it sounds like a dry shampoo, Oribe claims that when using it, we can even skip a shampoo!</p><p>It’s true this powder spray does double as a vegan dry shampoo. But it actually can help our scalp instead of drying it out like most dry shampoos often do. The formula relies solely on natural ingredients like aloe vera, which of course every beauty lover knows is amazing. Aloe vera can help to treat dry, itchy scalps and make them feel hydrated. But that’s not the only benefit!</p><p>It can also help to improve our hair’s overall health while the antioxidants within its formula work towards strengthening hair to withstand damage-inducing free radicals. Think of it as the spray that looks to serve and protect.</p><p>So what sets it apart from other dry shampoos out there? It’s simple. This product gives our hair that grit and texture it’s often lacking or missing when it’s freshly washed. Well, at least that’s what Vanderpump Rules hairstylist <strong>Bradley Leake </strong>is claiming!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1083374992.jpg><p><strong>See it: Grab the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Oribe Swept Up Volume Powder Spray</a> for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$42</a>, available at Dermstore!</strong></p><p>The secret to achieving good hair? Well, that’s simple if asking Leake! He recently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared with Bravo</a> that “creating the right texture for your hairstyle is all about the right products” and this Oribe powder spray was just the ticket. It added that gritty texture that Madix needed to rock a half-up, half-down look with super long extensions added to her normally chin-length bob for an appearance on Watch What Happens Live in January.</p><p>The hairstylist also offered a tip we can all use. “Less is definitely more with this product,” he said. “A little bit goes a long way.”&nbsp;Noted!</p><p>What’s the easiest way to explain what this product does? Think of it as the simple spray that gives our hair that “lived in look.” Whether we’re born with thick, thin, curly or even straight hair, this spray is perfect for all hair types.</p><p>Call it the game-changing (or hair-changing, in this case) product that can help our tresses look thicker, more voluminous and larger-than-life. Whether we’re looking to create messy fishtail braids, high ponytails like Madix’s or even just give our blowouts some extended life, everyone can benefit from adding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this Bravolebrity-approved volume powder spray</a> into their daily hair routine!</p><p><strong>See it: Grab the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Oribe Swept Up Volume Powder Spray</a> for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$42</a>, available at Dermstore!</strong></p><p><strong>Not into it?
