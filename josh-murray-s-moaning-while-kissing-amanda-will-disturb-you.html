Watch <i>Us Weekly</i>&nbsp;Video’s compilation of his odd smooching sounds above!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><i>The Bachelorette</i><span> season 10 winner, 31, arrived on the beach in the episode and immediately butted heads with former foe&nbsp;</span><b><a href=#>Nick Viall</a></b><span>, who was the runner-up to Murray for </span><span><a href=#>Andi Dorfman</a>’</span><span>s affections during the season that aired in 2014. The August 8 episode proved there is clearly no love lost between the men, with Viall mentioning the particularly negative claims Dorfman made about her ex-fiancé in her recent book, </span><i>It’s Not Okay:&nbsp;Turning Heartbreak Into Happily Never After</i><span>. (</span><a href=#>Click here for more details</a><span> on her allegations.)</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>The two guys both had eyes for </span><b>Amanda Stanton</b><span>, and Viall took umbrage with Murray for asking the single mom on a date so soon after her outing with Viall.&nbsp;</span><span>Murray and Stanton’s sailing adventure went well, but viewers may have suddenly found themselves on Team Nick, if only to avoid having to listen to Murray’s moaning during his kisses, which some fans thought was off-putting.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Indeed, plenty of watchers took to Twitter to share their dismay at his guttural utterances. “</span><span>Evan [Bass] may be an awful kisser, but at least he doesn’t moan while kissing like Josh Murray. Gross,”&nbsp;<a href=#>tweeted</a> one fan.</span></p><p><span>“Why does Josh moan so much while he’s kissing Amanda?”&nbsp;<a href=#>wrote</a> another user. “It’s ultra ultra creepy. Like the creepiest thing ever.”</span></p><p>Check out the video above to experience the grunting for yourself. But a word of warning: There are some things you just can’t unhear.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Bachelor in Paradise</i> airs on ABC Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGoq5hiura%2B0ZqwrGWdpK6vtc2gZLCgmaGybrfIrKqippdirq6tzZ2YZq%2BZoblusMisq66qkmLGsMGMsGtsa2NugXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
