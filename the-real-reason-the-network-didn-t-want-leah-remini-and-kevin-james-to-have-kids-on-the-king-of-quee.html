However, as it turns out, that was no coincidence. In fact, the show's creators specifically opted not to show the Heffernans become parents.</p><p>So, what was the reason?</p><p><strong>Updated October 3, 2023:</strong> More than a decade on since The King of Queens aired its final episode, Leah Remini and Kevin James have continued to stay friends, and gushed over the impact the show had on their lives. In fact, in late September, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">both took to Instagram to share sweet tributes to their time on the show</a>.

With the comedic antics of the trio, some might wonder why the couple Doug and Carrie never had kids along the way - especially since by the end of the show's run, they'd been married for years.</p><p>Although it's no big deal that the couple ended up not having kids of their own, it turns out that storyline did not come from the show's writers. Instead, it was decided by the studio.</p><p>Speaking to The Futon Critic, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">executive producer of the show, David Bickel gave a few reasons as to why that was the case</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For starters, he explained, there tends to be a perception amongst audiences that characters having a baby creates something of a life raft for the show, and even gives the impression that writers are out of other ideas.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow title="Patton Oswalt Went Off Script And Trolled The King Of Queens By Not Moving An Inch During An Entire Scene">Leah Remini Took An Aggressive Approach To Her New King Of Queens Deal With CBS, And Got Kevin James Type Money Because Of It</a></span></p><p>There was also a pragmatic reason, on the network's end. That was, having seasons set "pre-baby" and "post-baby," was likely to impact syndication of the show.</p><p>Most hilariously, though, Bicket joked that for many viewers, there already was a baby figure in the cast: Carrie's father, Arthur.</p><p>Sure enough, Arthur Heffernan was known for his childish antics throughout the show's run, so adding an actual baby into the mix would have undoubtedly have changed the dynamic fans knew and loved so well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-constant-fighting-of-doug-and-carrie-might-have-contributed-to-this-decision>The Constant Fighting Of Doug And Carrie Might Have Contributed To This Decision</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/still-of-leah-remini-and-kevin-james.jpg><p>As anyone who so much as drifted in and out of watching The King of Queens will know, one of the hallmarks of the show was Doug and Carrie's tempestuous relationship.
