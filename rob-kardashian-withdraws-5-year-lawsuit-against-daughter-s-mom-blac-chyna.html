But it’s finally come to an end, as the television personality released a statement confirming he has withdrawn his lawsuit.</p><p>According to <a href=#>PEOPLE Magazine</a>, Rob filed a dismissal request with the court on Tuesday to have the lawsuit drop. <a href=#>Afterwards, he released a statement</a> explaining his decision was motivated by a desire to better co-parent their 5-year-old daughter, Dream.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Tinder Swindler' Simon Leviev Still Living Lavishly As He's Seen Shopping For Ferraris</a></span></p><p>"My love for Dream far outweighs my desire to proceed with my claims against her mother in a public trial," he stated.</p><p>He continued on to say that the court had found “sufficient evidence” to proceed with a jury trial, which made Rob realize he didn’t want to put his family through that process. “For our daughter's sake, I am dismissing the action and focusing on my co-parenting relationship with Chyna,” he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rob and Chyna first when public with their relationship in January 2016, when she posted a photo of them on social media with the caption, “The beginning.” Only ten weeks after, the couple announced their engagement.</p><p>Chyna went on to reveal her pregnancy in May 2016. <a href=#>The couple continued to be on-and-off</a> while Chyna was expecting Dream before ultimately broke-up the following year.</p><p>Rob filed the lawsuit in 2017 after a domestic assault incident with Chyna in which he claims she choked him with an iPhone charging cord during an argument. The fight had taken place at Rob’s younger sister <a href=#>Kylie Jenner’s home</a>.</p><p>In addition to injuries he said he suffered, Rob also claimed in the lawsuit that Chyna caused over $100,000 worth of damage to Kylie’s property. However, the Kylie Cosmetics later asked to be and was dismissed from the case in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following Rob’s dismissal of the case, Chyna’s lawyer, Lynne Ciani, gave a statement in which she said she wished Rob had made the decision long ago for the sake of their daughter.</p><p>"Rob Kardashian should have thought of his daughter Dream before he filed his malicious and baseless assault and battery lawsuit against Dream's mother,” Ciani stated.</p><p>She also hinted that Chyna has plans to pursue legal action against Rob, stating, “Chyna will now seek relief from the court to make sure that Rob cannot refile his lawsuit and to make him pay for her substantial litigation costs.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although this lawsuit may be dismissed, the legal battle between the Kardashian-Jenners and Blac Chyna are far from over. Chyna still has two lawsuits pending against the family – a defamation case set to appear in front of the jury in which Chyna says Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, and Kylie Jenner, and a case against Rob for releasing her nude photos on social media during one of their break-ups.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Netflix To Put $135 Million Into French, European Movies Over Three Years</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE Magazine</a>, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, <a href=#>E!
