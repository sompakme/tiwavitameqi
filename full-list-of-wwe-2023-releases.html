After WWE and UFC came together to form TKO Group Holdings, it sounded like maybe the cutbacks would be limited to office staff only. But, as names started to surface because the talents themselves posted on social media were gone, it became clear WWE was cleaning house again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These released stars have now been added to a few names that were already gone from WWE because of contract expirations or firings. Here are the names of the major releases so far in WWE for 2023:</p><h3 id=update-2023-12-15-07-30-est-by-ethan-schlabaugh>UPDATE: 2023/12/15 07:30 EST BY ETHAN SCHLABAUGH</h3><p>Just like any other year, there were a handful of WWE talent that were released from the company. 2023 saw an interesting batch and some pretty bad timing as the merger between WWE and Zuffa LLC became official to form TKO. Now with the year coming to an end, it is time to take note of every wrestler who was released from their contract (talent that asked to leave or outright quit won't be mentioned). Here are all the names that were released from their WWE and NXT contracts in 2023.</p><h2 id=dolph-ziggler-was-going-to-be-the-next-shawn-michaels>Dolph Ziggler Was Going To Be The Next Shawn Michaels</h2><h3 id=wwe-tenure-2004-2023>WWE Tenure: 2004-2023</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Age</p></th><th scope=col><p>Accolade(s)</p></th><th scope=col><p>Final Match</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>43</p></td><td><p>Triple Crown Champion, NXT Champion, Money In The Bank Winner</p></td><td><p>Vs.

This might have been the biggest shocker on Thursday. His resume boasts over 1500 matches and includes 685 wins in WWE and 38 PPV wins. He was a 2x World Heavyweight Champion, 1x NXT Champion, 6x Intercontinental Champion, 2x US Champion, and a 4x Tag Champion.</p><p>It was a nearly two-decade career with WWE, and he will go down as one of the best in-ring workers of this generation. To some, he was the "next Shawn Michaels". He seemed destined to be among the top guys in WWE and was a fan favorite, win or lose, could have been featured anywhere on the card and have been believable.</p><h2 id=shelton-benjamin-was-among-the-greats-from-ohio-valley-wrestling>Shelton Benjamin Was Among the Greats From Ohio Valley Wrestling</h2><h3 id=wwe-tenure-for-this-term-2017-2023>WWE Tenure For This Term: 2017-2023</h3><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Age</p></th><th scope=col><p>Accolade(s)</p></th><th scope=col><p>Final Match</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>48</p></td><td><p>United States Champion, Intercontinental Champion, Raw Tag Team Champion</p></td><td><p>Vs. The Viking Raiders, Main Event (09/11/23)</p></td></tr></table><p>Like Ziggler, Benjamin had an impressive resume. He posted 289 wins in WWE, with 41 PPV wins. He was a 3x Intercontinental Champion, 1x US Champion, 3x 24/7 Champion, 3x Tag Champion, and most recently, part of the now defunct Hurt Business faction.</p><p>Seen as one of the most gifted athletes in a group of OVW graduates that included Brock Lesnar, John Cena, and Batista, Benjamin had a great career, even if he never reached their levels of stardom. Benjamin confirmed his release on social media shortly after it was announced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elias-finally-quot-drifted-quot-away-from-wwe>Elias Finally "Drifted" Away From WWE</h2><h3 id=wwe-tenure-2014-2023>WWE Tenure: 2014-2023</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Age</p></th><th scope=col><p>Accolade(s)</p></th><th scope=col><p>Final Match</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>36</p></td><td><p>24/7 Champion</p></td><td><p>Intercontinental #1 Contender Battle Royal, Raw (05/15/23)</p></td></tr></table><p>Known for some time as The Drifter from NXT, Elias became quite popular as a heel and then WWE tried to turn him into a babyface musician, even releasing songs that were put out on iTunes. He lost a lot of momentum and was taken off of programming for some time. He returned as Ezekiel (Elias' brother), and that took off thanks to some help from Kevin Owens. But, it didn't last as he was repackaged again as Elias and then drifted away (pun intended).</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/5-times-a-wwe-release-hurt-a-wrestler-s-career-5-times-it-helped-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>5 Times A WWE Release Hurt A Wrestler's Career (& 5 Times It Helped)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>While no one likes to get fired, some WWE releases have helped wrestlers completely reinvent their careers elsewhere.</span><p>WWE was never able to get his career back on track and rumors spread in early September that he was likely done with the company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-39-s-departure-was-awkward>Emma's Departure Was Awkward</h2><h3 id=wwe-tenure-for-this-term-2022-2023>WWE Tenure For This Term: 2022-2023</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/emma-wwe.jpg><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Age</p></th><th scope=col><p>Accolade(s)</p></th><th scope=col><p>Final Match</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>34</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>Vs.

She had just posted a promotional tweet for WWE's return to Australia when she learned that she wouldn't be joining them on the trip because she'd been fired. She posted a follow-up tweet saying, "Oops nevermind. I just got released… I am no longer with WWE."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Emma had been released before and was brought back by Triple H. Her return didn't amount to much, eventually becoming the manager for real-life finance Riddick Moss, who was also released. Moss was a talented and strong performer who had a solid run with Baron Corbin, but when he split and was no longer Madcap Moss, there wasn't much for him creatively.</p><h2 id=mustafa-ali-was-in-the-middle-of-a-nxtfeud>Mustafa Ali Was In The Middle Of A NXTFeud</h2><h3 id=wwe-tenure-2016-2023>WWE Tenure: 2016-2023</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Age</p></th><th scope=col><p>Accolade(s)</p></th><th scope=col><p>Final Match</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>37</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>Vs.

He wrote, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"I am longer working with WWE. I look forward to the future. Thank you."</a> It isn't clear if this was a mutual decision or a release as Ali has had public issues with the way he'd been used in the past by WWE, having previously requested his release and it not being granted.</p><p>Considered one of the better in-ring talents, Ali was all over the place with his gimmicks and characters, sometimes getting pushed and other times disappearing for weeks if not months.</p><h2 id=rick-boogs-could-shred-on-a-guitar>Rick Boogs Could Shred On A Guitar</h2><h3 id=wwe-tenure-2017-2023>WWE Tenure: 2017-2023</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Age</p></th><th scope=col><p>Accolade(s)</p></th><th scope=col><p>Final Match</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>35</p></td><td><p>24/7 Champion</p></td><td><p>Slim Jim Battle Royal, SummerSlam 2023</p></td></tr></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Several fans felt bad for Rick Boogs when his name was announced among those released. He was on a big push and seemingly destined for big things until he was on the receiving end of a bad knee injury.</p><p>He missed a ton of time and when he came back, was repackaged as a hyper-active rock star. It didn't mesh with the audience, and he wasn't used again. Boogs had the look and was charismatic, proven during his time with Shinsuke Nakamura on the main roster.</p><h2 id=former-women-39-s-tag-champion-aliyah-spent-the-longest-time-in-nxt>Former Women's Tag Champion Aliyah Spent The Longest Time In NXT</h2><h3 id=wwe-tenure-2015---2023>WWE Tenure: 2015 - 2023</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Age</p></th><th scope=col><p>Accolade(s)</p></th><th scope=col><p>Final Match</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>29</p></td><td><p>Women's Tag Team Champion</p></td><td><p>Vs.

She was not brought back onto programming as Rodriguez moved on to other things and new tag partners. Aliyah had been reportedly sitting at home waiting for WWE Creative to come up with something for her.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She confirmed her release when she wrote, "As of today I am no longer a part of WWE."</a></p><h2 id=top-dolla-and-michael-cole-made-great-tv>Top Dolla And Michael Cole Made Great TV</h2><h3 id=wwe-tenure-2020-2023>WWE Tenure 2020-2023</h3><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Age</p></th><th scope=col><p>Accolade(s)</p></th><th scope=col><p>Final Match</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>33</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>Vs.

The outspoken big man, he was viewed by many as the least-capable wrestler of the bunch, making front page news and becoming the brunt of jokes by the announce crew when he famously tried to dive over the top rope and got all of two inches off the ground. He never really lived it down and became a jobber for other stars on the SmackDown brand.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wrestlers-wwe-regretted-releasing.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>10 Wrestlers WWE Regretfully Released (& Became Superstars Elsewhere)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>WWE came to regret releasing these wrestlers as they went on to become superstars elsewhere.</span><p>His gimmick was that he was a part-time rapper, and he often said things in his raps that got him into hot water.

At first, they were managed by LA Knight (then known as Max Dupri) as part of the Maximum Male Models before Knight dropped the character and Maxxine Dupri took over.</p><p>The team didn't find much success and was soon jobbing to other teams and used as a commercial break or comedy gimmick. Both Mace and Mansoor made a surprise appearance at Deadlock Pro-Wresting's 2nd Anniversary show.</p><h2 id=the-mixed-martial-artist-matt-riddle-brought-headaches-to-wwe>The Mixed Martial Artist Matt Riddle Brought Headaches To WWE</h2><h3 id=wwe-tenure-2018-2023>WWE Tenure: 2018-2023</h3><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Age</p></th><th scope=col><p>Accolade(s)</p></th><th scope=col><p>Final Match</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>37</p></td><td><p>United States Champion, Raw Tag Team Champion, NXT Tag Team Champion</p></td><td><p>Vs. The Viking Raiders, Raw (09/04/23)</p></td></tr></table><p>It's common for WWE to put up with controversial talents if they are popular enough, but it seems the company hit its breaking point with Matt Riddle. A popular wrestler who nevertheless found himself in the news headlines for all the wrong reasons, it appears that WWE had enough of the Original Bro and released him from his contract.</p><p>The reason as to why hasn't been confirmed yet, with theories ranging from UFC honcho Dana White's previous beef with the former MMA fighter to WWE simply not wanting to deal with Riddle anymore. A <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">source told Fightful Select</a> that Riddle had simply "burned through too many chances" with the promotion.
