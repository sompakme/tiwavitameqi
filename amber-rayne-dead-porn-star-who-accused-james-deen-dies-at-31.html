She was 31.</p><p><span>According to <i>AVN,</i> Rayne passed away in her sleep, but L.A. assistant chief coroner<b> Ed Winter </b>told the<a href=#> <i>New York Daily News</i> </a>that she had collapsed at her home in San Fernando Valley. “She evidently was with a friend. It was reported as a possible accident, a possible overdose,” Winter told the newspaper. Her autopsy has been scheduled for the end of next week.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span>Rayne acquired more than 500 credits over the course of her career. She retired in 2015 after a decade in the industry.</span></p><p><span>Stormy Daniels, the director of one of her films, <i>Wanted, </i>released a statement to <i>AVN</i> mourning the adult film star. “She was a really good friend, and one of the best actresses and performers that I’ve ever had the pleasure to work with,” Daniels said. “And I’m just glad that I had the opportunity to work with her and call her a friend.”</span></p><p>The Detroit native was one of the women to accuse male porn star James Deen of sexual assault. Rayne claimed in December 2015 that Deen punched her in the face. According to her account, she started bleeding so much from intercourse that the scene could not be finished.</p><p><span>“I can’t blame it on immaturity anymore,” Rayne said at the time of Deen. “I can’t blame it on being new to the industry and being some young kid. No, you know better.”</span></p><p>Deen denied any wrongdoing. “This situation was grossly distorted by the press,” he told the Daily Beast in an interview, adding that the video of the incident described by Rayne did exist. However, he claimed, “you can clearly see it not happening the way it is represented in the media.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapZKav26%2BwLKlnmWUmq6lec%2Boqadlo6mus3nWoaZmmZOYwrSxw2ahmqWVqHqlscSnZKieXaeusbGMnaCeq12WwW5%2FkGaua2hhaYJxew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
