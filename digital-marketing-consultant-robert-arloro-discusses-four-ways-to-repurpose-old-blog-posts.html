One of the challenges of a blog, though, is that you have to constantly come up with new topics to write about, according to <a href=#>digital marketing consultant Robert Arloro</a>.</p><p>The nice part about blogs is that they can be repurposed for other digital marketing needs. Rather than coming up with completely new content, you can take old blog posts you’ve already written and repackage them in a way that gives them new life.</p><p>Below are four practical ways to repurpose old blog posts in effective ways.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Create a Video</h2><p>Video is often the most effective way to reach an audience with your message online. People tend to absorb and remember combined visual and audio content more than they do visual or audio content separately. That’s what makes video so effective.</p><p>Your video doesn’t have to be complicated or even include complicated graphics and editing. You can simply appear in front of a camera and talk some of the main points of your blog post.</p><p>Not only will this give you additional exposure on new channels, such as YouTube, but you can also embed the video on your website and other social media pages.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Record a Podcast</h2><p>Another great idea is to start a podcast where you discuss the topics of your blog posts. Podcasts are growing exponentially in popularity, and that’s because people can listen to them as they go about their day.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Podcasts don’t take a lot of time to record</a>, and they can allow you to add some personality into your content. You can record them by yourself or with co-hosts. You can even bring on guest experts for certain blog topics that could use another voice.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Create an Infographic</h2><p>Infographics are a great way to take a lot of information and boil it down to a few quick points. They prove to be especially effective at taking relatively complicated topics and simplifying them into easy-to-digest nuggets.</p><p>If your blog post includes a lot of statistics, infographics are an extremely effective way of creating visual representations that allow your readers to understand your points better.</p><p>What’s more, infographics are highly sharable on social media, which gives you the potential to reach an even broader audience as your content is shared with others.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Write an eBook</h2><p>Robert Arloro says that writing an eBook could be particularly appropriate if you have blog content that is more in-depth or long-form — or if you would have the potential to expand on an old blog post to make it longer and more in-depth.</p><p>One of the best parts about eBooks is that you can use them as ways to build email lists. For instance, you can offer your eBook as a free download as long as people enter their email addresses.</p><p>This helps you to build a solid list of contacts that you could reach out to directly in the future or send email newsletters to.</p><p><strong>About Robert Arloro</strong></p><p><a href=#>Robert Arloro</a> is a digital marketer and marketing consultant with years of experience in the field.
