The sequel of the popular 1993 fantasy comedy film has been decades in the making, although <a href=#>Midler had been talking up the possibility</a> as far back as 15 years ago. Hocus Pocus is the story of three sister witches, who are summoned back to modern day Salem by a teenage boy. The follow-up film follows a very similar plot line, only that this time, they are recalled by three high school girls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Hocus Pocus 2 was made available to stream on Disney Plus</a> on September 30, with the original film having been released in theaters. The box office returns for that were very scant, and critical reviews were also damning.</p><p>It was only with the passage of time that the film picked up a cult following, sparking the plans for the sequel. Actress Thora Birch was another cast member of the first Hocus Pocus, but she did not appear in the second.</p><p>This prompted speculation regarding the reason for her absence, with some fans positing that she was intentionally <a href=#>written out of the script</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Kathy Najimy Has Done Since 'Hocus Pocus'</a></span></p><h2 id=who-did-thora-birch-play-in-hocus-pocus><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Who Did Thora Birch Play In Hocus Pocus?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The teenage boy who resurrected the Sanderson witches in Hocus Pocus was known as Max Dennison, and was portrayed by Omri Katz.</p><p>Thora Birch featured as Max’s sister, Dani Dennison.
