She was 17 years old. Now, at 34, <a href=#>she's rumored to be marrying Travis Kelce soon</a>, nearly a year since <a href=#>she first boosted the NFL's brand value</a>. Recently, that "Taylor Swift Effect" has been <a href=#>a concerning phenomenon for some experts</a>. But in 2019, it was the only reason people still went to see the Cats movie in theaters despite its cringe CGI.</p><p>Unfortunately, fans were disappointed that Swift only had a brief appearance in it. Seven years before the flop film, <a href=#>the cat-obsessed singer</a> auditioned for another musical – Les Miserables – which was also made by Cats director, Tom Hooper. However, the filmmaker turned her down due to "flattering" reasons that her "weird" stint in Cats didn't really make up for. Fast-forward to May 2024, Swift is reportedly getting a proper musical do-over with a Broadway project.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:00</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/your-paragraph-text-2024-06-08t193204-114.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift's Humble And Healthy Rider Demands Of Edamame And Water Are A Far Cry From Today's List">Taylor Swift's Humble And Healthy Rider Demands Of Edamame And Water Are A Far Cry From Today's List</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's rider demands have evolved over the years.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-was-supposed-to-peform-in-cats-alongside-another-artist>Taylor Swift Was Supposed To Peform In Cats Alongside Another Artist</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor-swif.jpg><p>In an interview with Vulture in December 2019, Hooper said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he got "very close" to casting Swift in 2012's Les Miserables</a>. But for "flattering" reasons, he felt she didn't deserve the role she auditioned for – Éponine (played by Samantha Barker). "She had auditioned for Les Mis. She rather brilliantly auditioned for Éponine," shared the British-Australian filmmaker. "I didn't cast her, but I got very close to it."</p><p>Hooper explained: "Ultimately, I couldn't quite believe Taylor Swift was a girl people would overlook. So it didn't quite feel right for her for the most flattering reason."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Years later, the Danish Girl director contacted Swift to play Bombalurina in Cats. "But I knew she was curious to work on a musical. When this came up, I wrote to her and just said, "Would you like to meet? Would you like to see the world I’m creating?" And I did a presentation," Hooper recalled. "Eve Stewart had these wonderful paintings she did of the world."</p><p>He added: "<strong>I had a ten-second clip of a dancer with fur, lifelike. That was my pitch. She loved it and was very gracious and really supportive from then on. </strong>At that point, I had no idea she'd end up getting involved in writing the new song and getting involved as a lyricist." Hooper also revealed that Swift was set to share her part with an unnamed performer. But a phone call with Cats creator Andrew Lloyd Webber changed everything.</p><p>"In the show, it's performed by two women," said the director. "And for a long time, I thought, Well, it's going to be Taylor Swift and X. Then eventually, part of me was like, Why does it have to be two people?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"<strong>I called Andrew and said, 'Just remind me why.' And he goes, 'Oh, we only gave it to two people because we felt guilty that the other girl didn’t have enough to do.' Apparently, it was originally designed for one person</strong>," Hooper recounted. "I called Taylor up. 'Do you mind if you do it by yourself?' She was obviously totally happy with it."</p><p>According to sources, Taylor Swift was paid $3 million to play Bombalurina in the Cats movie.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/taylor-swift-s-decision-to-re-record-her_gr-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift’s Decision To Re-Record Her Old Songs Impacted Her Net Worth Five Years Later">Taylor Swift’s Decision To Re-Record Her Old Songs Impacted Her Net Worth Five Years Later</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift re-recorded her old songs to gain ownership, and this big decision reflected in her fortune.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-has-quot-no-complaints-quot-about-her-quot-weird-quot-dad-inspired-appearance-in-39-cats-39>Taylor Swift Has "No Complaints" About Her "Weird" Dad-Inspired Appearance In 'Cats'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gm6a9chxqaarkze.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In January 2020, Swift said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">she had no regrets doing Cats in 2019</a>. However, she agreed that it was "a weird-a** movie." At that time, her co-written film track, Beautiful Ghosts was nominated for a Golden Globe. Responding to the recognition, she said: "I'm happy to be here, happy to be nominated, and I had a really great time working on that weird-ass movie." The Fortnight songstress is even proud of joining the then-trolled cast.</p><p>"I'm not gonna retroactively decide that it wasn't the best experience. I never would have met Andrew Lloyd Webber or gotten to see how he works, and now he's my buddy."</p><p>She added: "I got to work with the sickest dancers and performers. <strong>No complaints</strong>." Before that, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Swift credited her dad for inspiring her famous psychedelic scene in Cats</a>. "And so in the middle of this meeting, Dad just pipes up and says, 'Hey, I got an idea. What if you had a scene where they are all at the Jellicle Ball and they all get catnipped so they all just start going crazy?'" she told Variety back then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She then recalled that Hooper had no idea what "catnipped" was. "Tom Hooper goes, 'What's catnipped?'" said Swift. "All of us are like, 'You don't know what catnip is?' <strong>We start pulling up all these YouTube videos of cats on catnip. Tom looks at Dad and goes, 'That's going to be in the movie. That's exactly what we're going to do.'</strong>"</p><p>Now, Swift's father Scott Kingsley Swift, "walks around going, 'Hey, I'm the reason there's catnip in the scene.'" Looking back on that meeting, the Bad Blood hitmaker said: "For the first time, one of his mid-meeting bursts of inspiration has really turned into something. It's a really good moment for my dad." Here's how Swift's parents have supported her over the years:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>1989</p></td><td><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift's mom, Andrea named her with business in mind</a>.

At that time, she also referenced the Broadway project on Instagram, writing: <strong>"This post is dedicated to the new Tortured Poets section of the Eras Tour (aka Female Rage The Musical!)</strong> and everyone who made these memories so magical." She also thanked her "crew, fellow performers, and band who worked tirelessly in their break to concoct this surprise for you—but mostly for the fans in Paris."</p><p>She continued: "I'm so thankful it was you we got to show this to for the first time because you gave us so much excitement, passion, and love. I'm SO fired up to play this for every crowd on the tour. See you soon, Stockholm!"

Another Redditor set the record straight on what the trademark really meant.</p><p>"She filed a trademark application— not a copyright application," they wrote.
