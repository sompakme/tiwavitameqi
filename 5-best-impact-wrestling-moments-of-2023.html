The promotion remained consistent when it came to in-ring entertainment. It also brought in a little dose of nostalgia for fans of the old TNA.</p><p>Speaking of TNA, the rebrand will kick off on January 13, 2024. While we wait for nostalgia to mix in with great in-ring action, let’s take a look at the five best IMPACT moments of 2023:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-scott-d-amore-busts-out-a-canadian-destroyer>Scott D’Amore busts out a Canadian Destroyer</h2><p>Scott D’Amore deserves credit for turning IMPACT’s fortunes around. The Team Canada mentor should also be given his flowers for busting out a Canadian Destroyer at Sacrifice 2023.</p><p>D’Amore assembled of team of some heavy hitters to take out Bully Ray and his gang at the February 24 special event. After the babyfaces had cleared the ring, the IMPACT Wrestling President took out Jason Hotch with a thunderous Canadian Destroyer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Team 3D returns after seven years (IMPACT Wrestling 1000)</h2><p>IMPACT Wrestling has always been consistent when it comes to pulling off surprise reunions. The promotion did a terrific job by bringing together Bully Ray and Brother Devon inside the squared circle. The last time Team 3D appeared together was seven years ago.</p><p>The tag team specialists interrupted Desi Hit Squad’s promo segment at IMPACT Wrestling’s 1000th episode. The crowd popped huge to see the former Dudley Boyz appear in the IMPACT Zone. They also got the table for good measures.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Alex Shelley becomes IMPACT World Champion</h2><p>Alex Shelley is a veteran in every sense of the word. The real-life Patrick Kenneth Martin has competed all over the world. He’s won titles in promotions across the globe. His biggest achievement came when he won the IMPACT World Championship.</p><p>Shelley got his crowning moment at Against All Odds. He defeated Steve Maclin for the title in a solid match. The post-match angle saw Shelley’s tag team partner and X Division Champion Chris Sabin enter the ring to celebrate.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Trinity debuts in the IMPACT Zone</h2><p>Trinity (fka Naomi) made waves when she walked out of WWE with close friend Sasha Banks (aka Mercedes Mone). The former SmackDown Women’s Champion signed with IMPACT Wrestling in 2023. She made her televised debut for the promotion on the May 4 episode.</p><p>The former WWE star got a great reaction from the fans in attendance. She was soon interrupted by Deonna Purrazzo. Both women would meet for the IMPACT Knockouts Title at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Slammiversary 2023</a>. The rest is history.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>TNA is back (IMPACT Wrestling Bound for Glory)</h2><p>Bound for Glory was a monumental event for IMPACT Wrestling. From Will Ospreay’s Match of the Year against Mike Bailey to Jordynne Grace’s shocking win in the Call Your Shot Gauntlet Match, Bound for Glory lived up to its reputation as a consistent event.</p><p>The biggest moment of the night, perhaps, came when Scott D’Amore led a group of IMPACT wrestlers to announce the return of TNA. The crowd popped huge for the blockbuster announcement as chants of “TNA” took over the Cicero Stadium.</p><p>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best TNA Christmas Themed Matches</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZpudo6l6uL7ErKuloZ6cfHKAkmtrbmtdanqjsdKtZKKloJawtXnWq5ysrJyeu6h5zKiknqakqHqwsoxrZ2tr</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
