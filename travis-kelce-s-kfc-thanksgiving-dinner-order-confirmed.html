He received 56 pieces of KFC fried chicken and 80 hot and spicy wings. He didn’t skimp on the sides either, enjoying three catering-sized containers of mashed potatoes and gravy, two mac and cheese orders and two orders of corn, KFC confirmed to Us Weekly.</p><p>“Fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, mac and cheese and more — we have options for anyone in their KFC era this holiday season and beyond,” <strong>Nick Chavez</strong>, KFC’s U.S. CMO, said in a statement to Us. “Chiefly, we recommend our finger lickin’ good 2 for $5 KFC Wraps for any solo celebrations … on or off the field.”</p><p>Travis revealed his Thanksgiving plans during the Wednesday, November 22, episode of his “New Heights” podcast with brother <strong>Jason Kelce</strong>. “I’ll be feasting on KFC because I won’t have anybody here,” he said.</p><p>Jason, 36, invited Travis to Pennsylvania to join him, wife Kylie and their three daughters for their family’s Thanksgiving dinner. “If you want to make a quick trip, you’re welcome at the house, man,” he said. ‘We’ll have plenty of food.”</p><p>However, Travis didn’t seem too keen on flying to Philly on his day off. He had to return to Missouri quickly to prepare for the Kansas City Chiefs’ Sunday, November 26, game against the Las Vegas Raiders. “That’s exactly what I wanted to do this week,” Travis said ironically.</p><p>KFC quickly took notice of Travis’ plans, responding via Twitter, “@tkelce, you belong with us.” The comment obviously references one of Swift’s most famous songs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KFC-Confirms-What-Travis-Kelce-Ordered-for-His-Thanksgiving-Dinner-2.jpg><p>The singer, 33, was in Brazil during the holiday weekend amid the South American leg of her tour. Although Travis and Swift missed their first Thanksgiving together, sources revealed in <a href=#>Us Weekly‘s latest cover story</a> that they intend to spend Christmas and the New Year holiday together.</p><p>“Travis has already started Christmas shopping and has some really special surprises [for Taylor] in store,” one source exclusively told Us. “Their connection is off the charts, and they can’t wait to celebrate together.”</p><p>Between Swift’s wildly successful Eras Tour and Travis’ football training and games, the new couple have busy schedules, but they’ve been strategically planning out when they can <a href=#>spend time together</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“They have very detailed plans coming up while she’s on tour and he has games,” a second source explained to Us. “Taylor and Travis have the next few months completely laid out. They don’t want to start their relationship off with big gaps [in time spent apart]. They’re trying to be as much like a regular couple as possible.”</p><p>Swift and Travis started seeing each other earlier this year. She first <a href=#>attended a Chiefs game</a> in late September, and they were pictured holding hands in New York City the following month. Travis recently traveled to Buenos Aires on a bye week to watch the Grammy winner’s concert, and Swift was seen running into his arms <a href=#>with a kiss</a> after the November 11 show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZq2qkau2tHnKnqOcnaNiuKevjK2fmqabqLSqwsinnmacmaO7pr6MqKmdnaJisLC6xaKppp2UZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
