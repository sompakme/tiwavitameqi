The judge granted Wasser’s request and the file is now dead.”</p><p>The basketball player and the reality starlet tied the knot&nbsp;in September 2009 after a month of dating, and Kardashian filed for divorce in 2013 after months of speculation from the press. The cause for the split was cited as “irreconcilable differences,” with numerous outlets claiming Odom was having difficulty keeping his drug and alcohol problems&nbsp;under control and that he was cheating on Khloe.</p><p>The severity of his problems were brought to the forefront on Tuesday, Oct. 13 after Odom, 35, was <a href=#>found unconscious</a> at a Las Vegas, Nev. brothel after consuming an unknown amount of different drugs and alcohol. He was placed on life support after slipping into a coma until he regained consciousness a few days later. Kardashian flew to the hospital to be with him and reportedly never left his bedside. He was discharged from the hospital yesterday (Oct. 20), and will have to undergo months of physical therapy in order to help him along his long road to recovery.</p><p>After separating, Khloe was linked to rapper French Montana and most recently the shooting guard for the Houston Rockets, James Harden. Just yesterday (Oct. 20), it was <a href=# rel=nofollow>reported</a> that Kardashian, 31, placed her relationship with Harden on the back burner so that she could take care of Odom.</p><p>This proves that the love the two have for each other is extremely strong despite their issues in the past. Hopefully Odom makes a strong recovery and Khloe’s support helps him through it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6C1rbvEZqKaqpSWwKm1wKdkpZmdlr9uu8OopGabkaG5brvFn2Sdoaakv6SxjGxva21lbXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
