He explained his company did extensive research into animal welfare in Las Vegas before deciding to donate to Street Dogs, finding it to be “the most passionate, organized, and effective group, thus worthy of generous donations,” Phillips explained. He encourages others with financial means to donate to the cause, no matter how small.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luxury Real Estate Advisors specializes in the leasing, property management, and investor services of luxury properties, <a href=#>their website explains</a>. Under a section on their website titled ‘Philanthropy,’ the company details the lengths they’ve gone to in order to support charitable causes, namely those involved in animal welfare. “A significant portion of commissions are donated to animals in need of food, vaccinations, and lifesaving surgeries,” the section reads.</p><p>They also have a separate section that allows visitors to view animals up for adoption in the Las Vegas area. Visitors can use a variety of filters to find their perfect match in a pet, including type, size, and age. When they click on a pet’s profile, it redirects visitors to <a href=#>PetFinder’s website</a> for more information and to learn more about how they can adopt the animal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to their website, Street Dogz is dedicated to helping a wide variety of animals in need. Their services include spaying and neutering in effort to prevent pet homelessness as well as emergency housing, medical aid, and food assistance. They work primarily with cats and dogs found wandering the streets. They reportedly distributed 78,591 pounds of dry kibble, helped adopt 232 pets, and provided medical care to 396 animals in 2019 alone.</p><p>Street Dogz relies on donations from the public to keep their operation going. The ‘Give Help’ section of their website details the ways people can support their efforts and get involved. They offer a variety of donation levels, including a $25 tier that can cover the fees for an animal sent to the Animal Foundation. Their highest tier, set at $190, says it will cover the average veterinary cost for a pet without a home. If financial support is not an option, Street Dogz also has opportunities for in-person volunteers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Top Real Estate Agents Use Instagram To Sell Fast In New York</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PR Newswire</a>, <a href=#>Street Dogz</a>, <a href=#>Luxury Real Estate Advisors</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8uaqmaulZyutHnRnpilZZWowaLAxGabqKaRqbawuo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
