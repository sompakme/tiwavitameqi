He's doing very, very well for himself. Best known as the front-man of the wildly successful, internationally recognized band Limp Bizkit, Durst has toured the world, played on the biggest stages, and has maintained a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> massive fan following</a>. His work as an artist has spanned across many genres, and wasn't just capped to the music industry. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rock Celebrities</a> reports, Durst has been at the heart &nbsp;of some heavily controversial statements made about other entertainers,&nbsp;and&nbsp;at one point had even&nbsp;taken a hiatus from his career, yet he maintains his status as one of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the most successful musicians of our time</a>, and sits upon an impressive $20 million net worth.</p><h2 id=paving-the-way-to-success>Paving The Way To Success</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Durst has always had his eyes firmly set on expanding his career and his wealth. He has been working since he was very young, and continues to add to his fortune in a variety of different ways.</p><p>As a young man, Durst hustled by mowing lawns to make quick cash, and then went on to become <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a tattoo artist</a>. His <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">side hustles </a>allowed him to save enough money to pursue his passion, which was to find a way to combine his two favorite musical genres,&nbsp;heavy metal and hip hop.</p><p>In 1994 Fred Durst joined forces with Sam Rivers and John Otto as founding members of the band Limp Bizkit. They were new at the game, and didn't see immediate success, going on to sign Wes Borland and DJ Lethal to their band. Before long they became well known in the underground music scene, and fans were flocking to see the unique, dark twists they were giving to the cover songs they performed at late night shows. Their version of Faith by George Michael,&nbsp;was one of their most popular. Seeing an opportunity, Durst gave the bassist of Korn, Reginald Arvizu a tattoo and seized that moment to introduce him to his demo tape. This led to the band's deal to tour with Korn as their opening show. Their first record deal soon followed, as well as the release of their first album, Three Dollar Bill Y'all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fred Durst and Limp Bizkit truly rose to fame and became beloved mainstream artists&nbsp;when&nbsp;the release of their subsequent albums,&nbsp;Significant Other and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water put them on the map by soaring to the top of the Billboard charts.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebel With A Bank Account: Kid Rock's $100 Million Story</a></span></p><h2 id=definitely-not-limping>Definitely Not Limping</h2><p>Fred Durst has amassed most of his wealth through album sales and the substantial income earned by touring with the band. Of course, the sale of band-based merchandise has also padded his wallet, and as the popularity of Limp Bizkit grew and they became a bonified, worldwide sensation, finances were no longer of any concern.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Success in the music industry typically comes in waves, with greater interest shown by fans during the moments immediately before, during, and after the release of a new album.
