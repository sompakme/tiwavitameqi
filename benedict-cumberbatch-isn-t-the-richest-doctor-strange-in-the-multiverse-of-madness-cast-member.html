But with several iconic Hollywood names forming the cast, who exactly can fans expect to see in this star-studded ensemble? And who comes out on top as the highest-earning? Let’s take a look at the stars of Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness ranked by net worth.</p><h2 id=xochitl-gomez---1-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Xochitl Gomez - $1 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coming in and taking the ninth spot on the list we have the film’s breakout star, Xochitl Gomez. Despite her young age, the 16-year-old actress is anything but a newcomer to the acting industry. Prior to starring in Marvel’s most recent blockbuster, Gomez had just over 20 onscreen acting credits to her name. Whilst the majority of her work has been in short films, the actress’ most notable role is that in the series The Babysitter’s Club in which she portrayed the role of Dawn Schafer. In Doctor Strange In the Multiverse Of Madness, Gomez portrays the role of America Chavez, a young teen with the ability to travel through universes and Marvel’s first-ever LGBTQ+ superhero. According to The Wiki Feed,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actress’ net worth comes in at $1 million</a>.</p><h2 id=hayley-atwell---3-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Hayley Atwell - $3 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coming in next and taking the eighth spot on the list is London-born and past Marvel alum, Hayley Atwell. The actress reprised her role as Peggy Carter who had previously appeared in several of Marvel’s projects such as Captain America: The First Avenger, Agent Carter, and the animated What If…? series. This time around, however, in Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness, Atwell portrayed the role of Captain Carter from a different universe who, after having taken the super-soldier serum instead of Captain America, made up part of Marvel’s Illuminati. Other notable roles of Atwell’s include Aliena in the 2010 series, The Pillars Of The Earth, and Mittens in Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway. According to Celebrity Net Worth,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the actress comes in at $3 million.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=benedict-wong---3-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Benedict Wong - $3 Million</span></h2><p>Coming in next and ranking the same as Atwell is the sorcerer supreme and Doctor Strange’s loyal partner, Benedict Wong. Prior to becoming an MCU star, Wong had a well-established career with acting credits dating way back to 1992. Notable roles of his include, Kublai Khan in the 2014 series Marco Polo, and Bruce Ng in the Academy Award-nominated 2015 film The Martian.

In the film, the Olsen sister portrays the role of Wanda Maximoff otherwise known as “The Scarlett Witch”. Olsen has been portraying the role of Wanda since 2015 when she was introduced in Avengers: Age Of Ultron. However, her role as Scarlett Witch came far later in 2021 with the release of her solo Disney+ series WandaVision. With a net worth of $11 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, Olsen ranks sixth on the list.</p><h2 id=chiwetel-ejiofor---16-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Chiwetel Ejiofor - $16 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coming in next we have another big name returning to his Doctor Strange role with Chiwetel Ejiofor. Academy Award-nominated Ejiofor was first introduced into the franchise in 2016 in the first Doctor Strange feature as Baron Modor.

Mean Girls star Rachel McAdams was arguably one of the most prominent Hollywood It girls of the early aughts, because of her plethora of roles such as those in Mean Girls, The Notebook, and The Hot Chick. In Doctor Strange, McAdams portrays a brilliant doctor who captures Strange’s affections, Christine Palmer. With a net worth of $25 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, McAdams just about misses out on a spot on the top three podia.</p><h2 id=benedict-cumberbatch---40-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Benedict Cumberbatch - $40 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coming in third is the star of the show, Doctor Strange himself, Benedict Cumberbatch. Although Cumberbatch has acting credits dating way back to 2002, it was that as the titular character in the BBC series Sherlock that really catapulted the actor to fame. In 2016, he brought the iconic Marvel character of Doctor Strange to the big screen and has been portraying the mystical sorcerer for 6 years since. With a huge net worth of $40 million, as reported by Celebrity Net Worth, Cumberbatch places third on this list.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 'Doctor Strange' Memes That Are Just Too Much To Take</a></span></p><h2 id=sir-patrick-stewart---70-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sir Patrick Stewart - $70 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And now for the top two highest-earning cast members of Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness.
