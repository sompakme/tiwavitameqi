The duo tied the knot in none other than Las Vegas back in 1998.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to their nuptials, Electra was the "it" girl who made her on-screen debut on the hit show, Baywatch, in which she appeared alongside David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson, to name a few. Carmen later made her move over to Playboy, which she has appeared on over 40 times!</p><p>The star caught the attention of high-profile athlete, Dennis Rodman, who is both known for his skills on the court and being one of the few American celebs to have met and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hung out with Kim Jong Un</a>. Despite their passionate fling, their marriage ended after only a week, becoming one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shortest celebrity marriages ever!</a> So, what led to the duo's split? Let's find out!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Look At Dennis Rodman’s Exes, In Photos</a></span></p><h2 id=why-carmen-electra-divorced-dennis-rodman>Why Carmen Electra Divorced Dennis Rodman</h2><p>Carmen Electra found herself reigning the '90s and early 2000s after having landed roles in a number of films and TV shows, including&nbsp;Scray Movie, Good Burger, and Baywatch, to name a few! This ultimately led the star to become the face of Playboy magazine countless times, 44 to be specific, making her one of the playmates with the most covers in history!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This ultimately caught the attention of former Chicago Bulls player, Dennis Rodman, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">became enamored with Carmen </a>after seeing her on Playboy and watching her alongside David Hasselfhodd and Yasmine Bleeth in Baywatch.&nbsp;</p><p>After meeting one another, Carmen revealed that they had "exchanged numbers and he would call and call and call," she said. "I wouldn't respond. Finally, one day, I picked up the phone and he invited me to come hang out with him and I went for it. I went in," she finished.</p><p>Electra definitely had a thing for bad boys at the time, and considering Rodman was the "bad boy of basketball," as Carmen explained, it was clearly a great match! It didn't take much time before they were head over heels for one another, so much they'd get up to all kinds of funny business, sometimes even in the coach's office! "I'd have to say, sorry, coach," Carmen laughed off during an interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here Are The 18 Shortest Celebrity Marriages Ever</a></span></p><p>Well, after dating for a few months, the duo found themselves in Las Vegas back in 1998, partaking in what the media has labeled as an "all-night bender," which ultimately led the two to say their "I do's" in a wedding chapel!</p><p>The marriage ended up lasting less than a week, and while there was no single reason for their split, Carmen revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there was no way the marriage would last</a>, considering how it began.</p><p>After losing her mother and older sister only 2 weeks apart in August 1998, it became evident that Carmen was not in the best headspace, hence the couple's poor decision-making at the time.</p><p>The two amicably annulled the marriage after coming to their senses, and have remained supportive of one another since!&nbsp;“Yes, we had a blast and this wild love, but we had a lot of hard times, too. A lot of struggles,” she said. “No matter what, I’ll always wish him the best," Carmen said, proving that she has nothing but love for her ex-husband of 6 days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Dennis Rodman Is Campaigning For Kanye West & Fans Are Confused</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmK6zucSnZJ6klZjBs62MmqWdZZSau6%2B10mapqJydlrtusMivpqublZl6orLTnqlmp56hxm6CjJ2Ysqtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
