The Boston-based jeweler surprised Niemi with a proposal on Christmas Eve.</p><p>Niemi was married to Dirty Dancing star Swayze for 34 years before he passed away at age 57 from pancreatic cancer in September 2009. After losing her beloved husband, Niemi opened up about what it was like to fall in love again <a href=#>in an April 2014 blog post</a>.</p><p>"They say that falling in love is wonderful," Niemi wrote on her website, while describing her feelings about DePrisco in great detail. "That sick feeling. The butterfly stomach, the rubbery legs, the diminished mental capacity," she wrote of her emotions. "A feeling of being paralyzed, like some kind of speared fish, floating helplessly after a powerful sedative."</p><p>In the same post, Niemi revealed how she felt after briefly splitting from DePrisco due to long-distance strains in 2013. "I spent the next two mornings sobbing inconsolably for hours in private," she wrote.</p><p>"My behavior was so crazy. But it had only been a few years since my husband had died, it was later that I realized that the separation had triggered all my fears, my emotions, the pain of, once again, having someone taken away from me."</p><p>"But I have to say, as devastating as the loss of my husband has been, would I go back and start all over again with him, even knowing the tragedy that lay ahead?" Niemi mused. "Yes. I would," she said. "A thousand times over."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Instead of walking away, or trying to find a way to be safe in a situation that threatens to annihilate me," she concluded, "Embrace ALL of it."</p><p>"Without holding back, without looking for a quick-exit rope."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaloaOWeq%2B1xKagZqiRqb%2Bqr8pmqrCZqa%2BytHnWopuor12irrO%2ByJ6qZpmcl7KzwIydnKmqmaiwsHmRaWhtamVqfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
