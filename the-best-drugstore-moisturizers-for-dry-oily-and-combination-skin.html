Even if you have oily skin, you will still benefit from using moisturizer.” This is why it’s so important to pick a product that aligns with your skin type. But how can you tell whether a moisturizer is a good pick or not?</p><p>According to Dr. Liu, an effective moisturizer contains three components: occlusives, emollients and humectants. Occlusives, such as petrolatum and fatty acids, help seal in moisture. Emollients, like petrolatum and fatty acids, also help seal in moisture but primarily soften the skin. Humectants, such as hyaluronic acid and glycerin, help draw water to the top layer of the skin to keep skin supple and hydrated.</p><p>Dr. Liu believes that there are a few universal moisturizers that work for all skin types. Still, a custom product designed for dry, oily or sensitive skin can help your skin thrive. Check out the following important factors to consider before making a purchase.</p><h2 class=section-title>What to Consider When Choosing the Best Drugstore Moisturizers</h2><h3>Skin Type</h3><p>Do you have dry, normal, oily or combination skin? Your answer will determine which moisturizers are best for you. All skin thrives on non-comedogenic hydrators such as glycerin, squalane, hyaluronic acid and aloe vera.</p><p>However, some skin types won’t be able to tolerate certain ingredients. Dry to normal skin, for example, is more likely to react to denatured alcohol. Normal to oily skin may become acne prone if your moisturizer contains overly-hydrating and potentially pore-clogging ingredients such as shea butter. Combination skin tends to do best with very few drying and irritating ingredients and lightweight hydration.</p><h3>Compatibility</h3><p>How compatible will your moisturizer be with the rest of your skincare routine? Applying a serum beneath your cream, gel, or lotion may cause the product to pill on your face, depending on the ingredients. Unfortunately, you won’t know whether your skincare products are compatible until you try them together, so you may need to try a couple moisturizers to find the right match.</p><h3>Ingredients</h3><p>Whether you have sensitive, dry, oily, normal or combination skin, knowing what’s in your moisturizer is extremely important. A few irritating or comedogenic ingredients can make or break a formula, no matter how much you love the other ingredients. If you’re unsure of any ingredients, check your product on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">INCIDecoder</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">SkinCarisma</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">EWG Skin Deep</a>.</p><h3>Bottle Design</h3><p>Moisturizers usually come in two container styles: hand scoop and pump. A hand-scoop container means you dip your fingers into the container, which isn’t as sanitary but allows you to use all of the product. These containers are also more easy to recycle. In contrast, a pump container is more sanitary but less environmentally friendly, and some of the product will forever be lost inside the pump.</p><h3>Price</h3><p>Drugstore moisturizers tend to be less expensive than other moisturizers on the market, but prices can add up quickly. These days, the best deal is a 14 to 16-ounce bottle of CeraVe or Vanicream for $10 to $16. Most other moisturizers offer only one to two ounces and range between $10 and $25 in price.</p><h2 class=section-title>What Are the Different Types of Drugstore Moisturizers?</h2><h3>Lotion</h3><p>In general, lotions <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">contain more water than creams</a>, which makes them lightweight and easy for your skin to absorb. Lotions are a great option for normal to oily skin, but be careful: Many lotions contain droplets of oil to increase hydration. While this may be great for the body, it isn’t always great for the face — especially if your skin is acne prone.</p><h3>Cream</h3><p>Creams are usually thicker than lotion and help create a barrier against cold, dry air which can draw moisture out of the skin. They are a great choice for people who naturally have dry skin. However, anyone can switch to a cream-based moisturizer in the winter months when they need it. Creams are not always ideal for people with oily skin because they provide too much moisture.</p><h3>Gel</h3><p>Gel moisturizers are effectively water-based lotions. They have the most water out of all moisturizers, and as a result they are easily absorbed into the skin. Plus, they are very lightweight and contain fewer emollients and oils, which makes them a great option for oily skin. Be careful about purchasing gels that are blue or green — these are unnatural dyes that may irritate sensitive skin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6eyt7XEsKpompWowW6w0a6erKyfp7Juuc6iqq2top7Hpr7SaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
