We haven’t found anything. There were a couple updates the day before yesterday — a few sightings around Mission Grove and Bathurst [Road] and in, like, a Sprouts shopping center parking lot, but we still haven’t found him, so anyone in the Riverside area, please keep your eyes out.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Scheana-Shay-Feels-%E2%80%98Helpless%E2%80%99-After-Her-Mom%E2%80%99s-Cousin-Goes-Missing.jpg><p>Tate, 67, was last seen at 5:30 p.m. at the Westmont Village assisted living facility in Riverside, California, which is located near Interstate 215 and Riverside National Cemetery. He is 6-foot-2 and 190 pounds, and was wearing tan khaki pants when he disappeared. Tate is diabetic and has dementia.</p><p>“He is not from the area so he will definitely be confused and disoriented,” Shay’s mother, Erika van Olphen, wrote via Instagram Stories on Thursday, February 27, explaining that Tate “was visiting his mother-in-law” at Westmont Village.</p><p>Van Olphen later announced that a missing person was filed with the Riverside Sheriff’s Department and that the California Highway Patrol issued a Silver Alert. She said that local churches, homeless shelters, hospitals and parks have all been searched by authorities and loved ones.</p><p>“I will continue to report this all on here because the power of social media is SO insane,” the Bravo personality’s mom wrote. “I never know who might see this and be able to provide ANY information to help.”</p><p>In another post later on Friday, van Olphen added, “We are still searching!!!

Please keep him in your prayers and let’s get him home safe!!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Several Vanderpump Rules cast members, including <a href=#><strong>Stassi Schroeder</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Tom Schwartz</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Lala Kent</strong></a>, have also reposted information about Tate’s disappearance in an effort to help locate him.</p><p>Anyone with information regarding Tate’s whereabouts is urged to call the sheriff’s Perris Station at 951-210-1000 or the sheriff’s dispatch at 951-776-1099.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasm5iarq%2BtjKyfmrFdm7KmuNJmn56koKGytL%2BMmp2tnaJiurC50maaqK2jnrtus86eqmalmajAqrrGaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
