Hear what she said in the clip above!</span></p><p>“We kinda just got together. It was a guy and a girl and it was f‑‑king horrible,” the TV personality, 32, told cohost and sex therapist <span>Dr.</span> <span><b>Chris Donaghue</b></span>. “It was the worst. I am literally having sleepless nights.… I felt the pressure, getting older, to experience new things and I did it against my better judgment because I talk about sex a lot.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/amber-rose-promos-7408216a-a7bd-4c21-b707-976ab4b6b683.jpg><p>Despite the allure of a ménage à trois, the <i>How to Be a Bad Bitch</i> author said that, ultimately, she finds that she prefers just one person underneath the sheets.</p><p>“And I hated it. Because I feel like I am a very passionate lover and I like that one-on-one passion,” the sex-positive star — who is gearing up to lead her second annual SlutWalk October 1 — shared. “With the threesome, I kind of felt like there was no passion. There was no kissing and rolling around, all of those moments that I enjoy. All those moments were not there.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>The former stripper then went on to crack a joke about asking her ex-husband,&nbsp;<b>Wiz Khalifa</b><span>&nbsp;</span><span>(with whom she shares son Sebastian, 3), to join her in the bedroom next time she is feeling a little frisky.</span></p><p>“You know what? Maybe I’ll call my baby daddy tonight,” she quipped. “I won’t do it again. Maybe if it’s two guys, but not with another girl.”</p><p>During the Friday, August 5, episode of <i>The Amber Rose Show,</i> Rose (whose most famous other ex is <b>Kanye West</b>) explained that she is rather old-fashioned when it comes to her love life.</p><p>“I feel like I’m just such a nerd in the bedroom. People really think that I have orgies all day and, like, I do these crazy sex acts,” the <a href=#>newly minted <i>Dancing With the Stars</i> contestant</a> said. “I’m like, ‘I’m really just a normal girl.'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapZKav26%2BzqycZqKlqMFutMCdZKGdomKzqr7SrWStoKKasrS7zJ5koZmkmrFutdNmrm1raGuAdHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
