Nearly one month after <a href=#><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Camila Morrone</strong></a> split following four years together, the actress was spotted in the front row of a <a href=#>Milan Fashion Week</a> runway show that featured his new flame, <a href=#><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>Morrone, 25, was photographed in the front row of Versace’s fashion show on Friday, September 23. While the&nbsp;<i>Valley Girl&nbsp;</i>actress was all smiles as she viewed <a href=#><strong>Donatella Versace</strong></a>’s latest collection, the <a href=#>Guest in Residence</a> founder, 27, was one of the models who sauntered down the catwalk.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Gigi-Hadid-Walks-Past-Camila-Morrones-Front-Row-Seat-During-Versace-Fashion-Show-After-Leonardo-DiCaprio-Split-Inline-02.jpg><p class=p1>While neither woman was spotted interacting after the show’s conclusion,&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>confirmed earlier this month that <a href=#>Hadid was dating the 47-year-old Oscar winner</a>.</p><p class=p1>“He thinks she’s beautiful of course but also a wise and cool character who’s got a very cultured and educated take on life,” a source <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in September</a>, noting the twosome have multiple mutual pals. “Everyone’s happy to see them together,&nbsp;even though it did catch a lot of them off guard.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Gigi-Hadid-Walks-Past-Camila-Morrones-Front-Row-Seat-During-Versace-Fashion-Show-After-Leonardo-DiCaprio-Split-Inline-01.jpg><p class=p1>The insider added at the time: “Leo plays it down but there’s no denying he does have a type, or he has until now. But at almost 48 he’s mellowing out a lot more and dropping hints to his buddies that he’s way less interested in that playboy lifestyle.”</p><p class=p1>DiCaprio’s <a href=#>penchant for dating models nearly half his age</a> has consistently made headlines through the years. Hadid, for her part, particularly caught his eye after they were <a href=#>assigned to sit at the same table at a New York Fashion Week afterparty</a> earlier this month.</p><p class=p1>Before starting something new with the supermodel, the&nbsp;<i>Titanic&nbsp;</i>star <a href=#>dated Morrone for nearly four years</a> before they went their separate ways.</p><p class=p1>“[Leo] has been attending events and going on vacations without [Morrone], from the Care Gala to Unicef Gala to Saint Tropez,” <a href=#>a second source previously told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in August</a>. “He has been spending more time hanging out&nbsp;with all his pals like&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Tobey McGuire</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Jamie Foxx</strong></a>.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Neither DiCaprio nor the&nbsp;<i>Death Wish&nbsp;</i>star <a href=#>have publicly addressed their split</a> before he moved on with Hadid. The former Victoria’s Secret Angel, for her part, previously dated <a href=#><strong>Zayn Malik</strong></a> on and off <a href=#>for five years before breaking up for good in October 2021</a>. The twosome have <a href=#>remained amicable coparents</a> to their daughter, <a href=#>Khai</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Our angel girl turned 2 today,” the fashion designer <a href=#>gushed via Instagram Story on Tuesday, September 2</a>, before sharing a subtle shoutout to the 29-year-old “Pillowtalk” crooner. “Her baba threw her the best party.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagoZeeeqmtw6KbZq%2BRobi0ec%2Baqq1lk5a6qrjAZqSoqqKku6Z5wK1kr52iqK6ksYysn6ivXZ67brnIpZinZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
