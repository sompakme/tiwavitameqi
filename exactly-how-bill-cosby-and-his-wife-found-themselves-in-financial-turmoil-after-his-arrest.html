While technically a free man, the former star of The Cosby Show has spent the last few years in dire financial straits due to the lavish lifestyle that he and his wife Camille have grown accustomed to. The thing is, the couple fails to generate the astronomical amounts of money that they once did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bill-cosby-and-his-wife-are-in-financial-turmoil-because-they-refuse-to-fire-any-of-their-staff>Bill Cosby And His Wife Are In Financial Turmoil Because They Refuse To Fire Any Of Their Staff</h2><p>Bill Cosby has tried to downsize his cost of living, but Radar Online claims that Camille Cosby is less keen on letting things go. The outlet <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports that Mrs. Cosby refuses to fire the staffers and chefs that have worked for her for decades</a>, despite the fact that these employees have not been paid for months, and the celebrity couple do not have the means to pay them in the immediate future.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bill-cosby-charges.jpg><p>A source for Radar Online went on to say that Bill Cosby is "frustrated" over the matter, and wants to let the staffers go, as he's unable to "live that lifestyle," but Camille won't budge on the matter. The source went as far as to label the topic a "major issue" in their marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This isn't the first time that rumors of marital problems have surfaced for the Cosby's. During Bill's prison stint, many claimed that Camille would leave the famous comedian, but the family spokesperson, Andrew Wyatt, issued a statement to People Magazine that laid the matter to rest:</p><p>"The accusations they have made in their tabloid are absolutely false. Mrs. and Mr. Cosby are not getting divorced and sheâ€™s with him in the Philadelphia home as we speak. No issues in the marriage, no issues with the children. These children are grown women in their 40s and 50s. These are not kids. These are not little kids running away from their father."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Wendy-Williams-Talking-About-Bill-Cosby.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Bill Cosby Tried To Get Wendy Williams Fired From Her Radio Show</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Wendy Williams Was Already "Dishing The Dirt" On Bill Cosby In 1990.</span><p>Steadfast as they might be in their commitment to their marriage, Bill and Camille Cosby have been hit with various financial setbacks since the former was released from prison.</p><h2 id=bill-cosby-and-his-wife-have-been-forced-to-pay-millions-in-property-taxes-to-the-irs-since-2019>Bill Cosby And His Wife Have Been Forced To Pay Millions In Property Taxes To The IRS Since 2019</h2><p>Bill Cosby was, for a time, <a href=#>one of the wealthiest comedians in Hollywood</a>.<strong> His estimated net worth was $400 million</strong>, according to Celebrity Net Worth, which was due to comedy tours and movie roles, as well as residuals from "The Cosby Show" and smart real estate deals. It has gone down drastically in the last decade, however, as Celebrity Net Worth <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">notes the listed amount does not reflect the most recent developments in Bill and Camille's lives</a>:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The future of his wealth is not yet known. Cosby reportedly spent millions of dollars on various legal defenses and could be liable for millions of dollars in future damages."</p><p>Bill and Camille Cosby have also been subject to various tax liens since 2019. The Blast obtained documents explaining that the comedian owed a combined $650,000 for failure to pay property taxes during his time in prison. He owed $88,566.88 for 2019 and $559,573.77 for the year 2020. He also had to pay $1.8 million in back taxes from the year 2015.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Year</p></td><td><p>Tax Amount Owed (According To The Blast)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2015</p></td><td><p>$1,831,150.41</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2019</p></td><td><p>$88,566.88</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2020</p></td><td><p>$559,573.77</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Between owing the IRS and refusing to fire staff, Bill and Camille Cosby have been forced to liquidate their assets and take out second mortgages on their various properties.</p><p>According to Radar Online, the couple have also resorted to selling parts of their art collection, which was valued at over $275 million.

AP News reports that a lawsuit was filed by a California woman who said that Cosby sexually abused her at the Playboy Mansion when she was 16.</p><p>The case was settled out of court in 2022, but Cosby had to pay $500,000. This amount does not take into account the $3.38 million that the comedian paid to Andrea Constand in 2006, or the defamation suit he settled against seven women for an undisclosed amount in 2019, according to NBC.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even if Cosby were to liquidate all his assets, and minimize his current living conditions, it's unclear whether he will have enough of an income to contend with the massive fees that are regularly handed him. CBS News revealed that the comedian owed $2.75 million in legal fees after his release from prison, and attempts to dispute the bill as "egregious" were rejected by a California judge.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bill-cosby-had-a-strange-request-for-david-letterman-s-interns-prior-to-his-interview.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The One Film Bill Cosby Refused To Promote Because Of How Bad It Was</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Bill Cosby would even warn fans not to watch a certain film because of how bad the final product was.</span><p>As long as Cosby is forced to sift through legal fees and accusations from past victims, the comedian will be unable to get on solid ground and provide the kind of lavish lifestyle that he and his wife Camille established in the 1980s. Tellingly, the fees and accusations will likely go on for the rest of his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZoqScYrCwv8GyZLChlpp6pK3MoqOlnV2jsrV51qipraBdm7avrc2coJqkXanCs7nOoqNmmZapsrN5wKupnqukYsCkrc2dmKVn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
