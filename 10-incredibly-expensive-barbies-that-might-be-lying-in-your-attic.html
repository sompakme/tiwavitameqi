Many people choose to put the box in the attic, to waste away for years&nbsp;as they gather dust amidst the other unused items we accumulate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Evolution Of The Barbie Doll From The 1950s To Today</a></span></p><p>What most people don't know is that they might own a Barbie that is worth a lot of money. There are plenty of collectors out there who are willing to pay a pretty penny for them. It might be worth digging through your dusty&nbsp;collection to see if the dolls you thought were useless can make you some money.</p><h2 id=pink-splendor-barbie---999>Pink Splendor Barbie - $999</h2><p>This doll maxed out at 10,000 units and it was released in 1997. The dress consists of silk and lace, complete with crystal jewelry. Her voluptuous updo is what draws the eye and makes her such a coveted doll.</p><p>It is best if it was never removed from the box, but if you find the right collector it can still be <a href=#>sold for a hefty price</a>. You might come across her in your attic storage container. With a little work, she could make you some decent money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sparkle-beach-barbie---2-000>Sparkle Beach Barbie - $2,000</h2><p>This Barbie is unique because it was never part of a limited edition set, making us wonder why so many people covet this standard Barbie. Most people only want her if she is brand-new and still in the box, but either way, people will pay money to have her. We are unsure if it was because of her sparkly blue swimsuit or if it was due to her golden flowing locks.</p><p>All that matters is that you head up to your attic to search for her, because your chances are high if you happened to play with Barbies as a child.</p><h2 id=gallerie-s-lafayette-blonde-barbie---2-000>Gallerie's Lafayette Blonde Barbie - $2,000</h2><p>This doll was only sold in the year 1999 at Gallerie's Lafayette Department Store in Paris, France. It was a limited edition creation and came with an entire wardrobe for you to play with.</p><p>Her outfit was quite reflective, but if you do own these, Barbie collectors are looking for it in its original packaging. If you or a family member happened to purchase a Barbie in France during this year it might be worth your while to tear apart your attic to find it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=american-girl-barbie---2-500>American Girl Barbie - $2,500</h2><p>This Barbie was unique because it had bendable legs, unlike the ram-rod straight legs of most dolls. Her official name was the Bendable Leg Barbie, but over time collectors have changed her name to American Girl.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Beyoncé And Jay-Z Gave Blue Ivy An $80,000 Barbie Doll And 14 Other Celeb Kids Who Got Wildly Expensive Birthday Gifts</a></span></p><p>She was on the shelves between 1965 and 1966, and she came with a striped swimsuit and gold wire stand. If you are unable to find the Barbie but were able to find the box, you can sell that alone for $200. You or your parents may have had one of these as they were quite popular at the time, and an excellent contender for becoming an attic treasure.</p><h2 id=the-walking-jamie-doll---2-500>The Walking Jamie Doll - $2,500</h2><p>This doll was sold between 1970 and 1972, and the theme was a girl walking her dog. The box included a small dog, as well as a coat and leash for the doll to walk it. It was a Sears exclusive item, and there were several different variations of this single toy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The extension packs included fold-able apartments for her to live in, complete with table and chairs for the ultimate Barbie experience. The 1970 version (called Furry Friends) will make you the most money, especially if you have all of the pieces and the original box.</p><h2 id=blonde-bubble-cut-barbie---2-999>Blonde Bubble Cut Barbie - $2,999</h2><p>This doll was in production between 1962 and 1967 and involved several variations, but it's the blonde that will bring you the cash. This was one of the Barbies produced during the first decade of their existence, which is why they are in such high demand among collectors.</p><p>She should include a red swimsuit, red heels, and a pair of pearl earrings to make her set complete. She also came with a gold wire stand, similar to the black one pictured above.</p><h2 id=pink-jubilee-barbie---3-000>Pink Jubilee Barbie - $3,000</h2><p>This Barbie is so popular because it was a limited edition for the 30th anniversary of Barbie's production. It was part of the Anniversary Dolls collection and was released in 1989. It was not actually sold on the shelves, so the only people who received these were in attendance at the party held at the Lincoln Center.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chances are (if you or your family&nbsp;went to the event) it was probably thrown in the back of your closet with the rest of your unused items.</p><h2 id=karl-lagerfeld-barbie---6-000>Karl Lagerfeld Barbie - $6,000</h2><p>This was another limited edition sell-out, and only 999 dolls were created. It is part of the Platinum Label and was released in 2014. She is dressed in a similar fashion to Karl Lagerfeld himself, complete with sunglasses and fingerless gloves.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>People Who Became Real Life Barbie & Ken Dolls</a></span></p><p>It was sold through exclusive retail networks for $200 when it first came out, but it has skyrocketed as its popularity increased. If you happened to get your hand on one of these, it is now worth $6,000! That'll be a nice addition to your bank account.</p><h2 id=barbie-in-midnight-red---17-091>Barbie In “Midnight Red” - $17,091</h2><p>This Barbie dates back to 1965. It's very popular, due to its rarity and age. She comes with a stunning red cape, red dress, and white satiny sleeves. Her brunette hair should be pinned up by a pink bow and the white fur around her collar should be pristine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She looks beautiful and it is easy to see why collectors strive to have her, and it is yet another excuse for you to clean out your dusty old attic.</p><h2 id=the-original-barbie-from-1959---27-450>The Original Barbie From 1959 - $27,450</h2><p>The first Barbie ever created has the largest price tag, because everyone wants to be the owner of the first product. She comes with a black and white striped swimsuit as well as a dashing pair of sunglasses. Her nails are painted a ruby red and her lips match, giving her a sass all young girls craved.</p><p>If you were a pioneer of dolls you probably owned this one, which is why you should dig through your old pile of Barbies to see if you happen to have it.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>29 Rare Barbie Dolls That Many People Might Still Own (That Are Worth A Ton)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaeSl7amv46vmKWtkZe5pnnMqKqtZZWtvaa60qKtnmWSlr%2BjtcSsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
