We’re sweating, the live band’s playing. It’s steamy, it’s going great.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> judge, who noted that this was “several years ago,” said things went awry when he dipped Lopez, 54, and then accidentally stepped on her hair.</p><p>“And I pull her back up, but her hair didn’t come back up,” he recalled, adding that Lopez “didn’t miss a beat” and mimicked her continuing to dance while picking up her hair from the ground.</p><p>Hough, for his part, said he had “no idea” what had happened until Lopez told him later in the night.</p><p>“She said, ‘Derek do you know what you did?’ I was like, ‘So you had the time of your life, what’s up?’ And she’s like, ‘No, you pulled out my hair!’” he recalled. “She has a chunk of it, and I’m like ‘I’m so sorry!’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Derek-Hough-Once-Thought-His-Friendship-With-Jennifer-Lopez-Was-Over-Because-of-One-Misstep2.jpg><p>He continued: “And then the next day she was like ‘Hey, do you want to do a project with me?’ And I was like, ‘Fantastic, ‘cause I thought our friendship was over.’”</p><p>Before Hough sat at the judges table on DWTS, he served as a judge alongside Lopez and <a href=#><strong>Ne-Yo</strong></a> on <a href=#>World of Dance</a>. (The show was ultimately canceled after four seasons in 2021.)</p><p>But the pair formed a friendship outside of filming the reality dance competition. In September 2018, Hough revealed he and his now wife, <a href=#><strong>Hayley Ebert</strong></a>, frequently double dated with Lopez and her then-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong></a>.</p><p>“Yeah, man. We go out all the time,” Hough told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> at the time. “You know, yachts,” he added jokingly.</p><p>In 2020, Hough sent a good luck video message to Lopez ahead of her <a href=#>Super Bowl halftime performance</a> and credited Rodriguez, 48, for putting together the gesture.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Of course I made a video wishing her good luck, wishing her the best,” he told <a href=#>Us</a>. “All the creative directors, everyone involved, I know all of them. … I’m just really happy for them all.”</p><p>After the performance, Hough sang his pal’s praises. “Jennifer was just so polished, a class act, I loved seeing her daughter sing! … It was so special, so cute,” he gushed. “I loved it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadnaKauG60zq6eoWWimrCiuMusZKannZq7tXnHnmStoJ%2BqtKnAjJ6lnZ2UYremus2inZ6qXaG8sbHZZp2roZWjsbS0yKlm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
