Professional actors and actresses have a duty to get into character, and often this involves forgetting everything they are and becoming everything their character is. Those who succeed in bringing their characters to life receive praise and accolades, and such success opens up new opportunities to further their careers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although everyone loves to be associated with a successful actor, especially close family and friends, a group of people in Hollywood suffers silently in the midst of success, and these are the wives and/or husbands of these celebrities. Regardless of how much you understand the business, and how much trust you've placed in your spouse, seeing him or her taking part in an intimate scene with another man or woman is bound to mess you up. The chemistry that characters share on stage and the lengths the directors often go to make the scenes look as real as possible are enough to spark jealousy and distrust even among the most powerful couples in Hollywood. Since marriages and relationships have ended because of one of the parties acting alongside talented and arguably better-looking co-stars, many Hollywood celebrity spouses are not always excited about the success of their significant other's films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since people believe that men are the weaker&nbsp;gender when it comes to cheating on their women, Hollywood wives often have to hope that their men will remember the commitment they made to them, especially when they're working. Here is a list of 15 actresses today's Hollywood wife would never want her husband to act alongside, especially if the script requires them to get intimate. Most of these women are young and single, and it's important to know that they can get any man they desire, and they would not need to go to great lengths to do so.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence><strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong></h2><p>How would you feel if you were an actor and your films grossed over $5.5 billion worldwide? If you would feel as if you were on top of the world, then that’s the feeling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lawrence</a> has every day. Lawrence's performances in church and school paid off when a talent scout got a glimpse of what she could do when she was just 14 years old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, Lawrence has topped the list of the highest-paid actresses on the planet on several occasions and has appeared on Forbes' Celebrity 100 and Time's 100 most influential people in the world lists on different occasions. She earned an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the 2012 film Silver Linings Playbook and has three Golden Globe Awards from this and other performances.</p><p>Lawrence's performance in the X-Men films as Mystique is always breathtaking, first because she's a great actress, and second because instead of wearing the conventional costumes like other characters, hers is made of paint. No Hollywood wife wants her husband acting alongside this beautiful woman when all she has on is paint instead of clothes. Her beautiful image is etched in most men's minds, regardless of what she's wearing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emilia-clarke><strong>Emilia Clarke</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emilia Clarke</a> is a 31-year old English actress, whose role as Daenerys Targaryen in the hit HBO series Game of Thrones has transformed her into a modern day s*x symbol and gained her critical acclaim. Among many accolades, she has three Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, and two Critics Choice Television Award nominations for the Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.</p><p>Almost every man on the planet who has watched Game of Thrones has a deep crush on Khaleesi, and married actors are no exception here. In its earlier seasons, the series had numerous scenes where the women&nbsp;revealed it&nbsp;all on screen, in addition to engaging in some&nbsp;steamy scenes. Since some of these scenes involved Khaleesi, it's easy to understand why she could be the star of most men's fantasies. No Hollywood wife would want her husband acting with Emilia Clarke, because they believe their husbands will only see her as the sexy Khaleesi, and the fact that she's single is terrifying.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-stone><strong>Emma Stone</strong></h2><p>If you watched La La Land, then you understand why <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Stone</a> is currently the highest-paid actress in the world. Judging from the awards and her performance in most of the movies she's been part of, Stone is one of the most talented actresses we have today. Some of the films her performance has been exceptional in include Crazy, Stupid, Love, The Amazing Spider-Man, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Birdman and of course La La Land. Her talent has also landed her in impressive publications such as in the Forbes Celebrity 100 and in the Time 100.</p><p>Stone is on this list because she is such a beautiful woman and she's just 29 years old. Her age, success, and beauty mean she can get any man she wants, and no Hollywood wife wants to compete with her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scarlett-johansson><strong>Scarlett Johansson</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarlett Johansson</a> is one of a number of celebrities who've caused quite a stir online regarding just how beautiful she is. In most of the discussions, you will find that many women will often claim there's nothing special about her and that she's just as beautiful as any other celebrity. However, men completely disagree and place her in the category of the most beautiful women in Hollywood.</p><p>There's universal consensus regarding how sexy her voice is and how blessed she is in the chest and hips areas, but most women, whose intention is not ill in any way, claim her face isn't all that. Scarlett makes it to this list and has every right to be here because many women don't understand how men are crazy about her, and no Hollywood wife wants to learn this lesson the hard way.</p><p>In addition to just how hot her body is, Scarlett knows how to choose her roles in a film, since almost all of them make her look tough, sexy, and feminine, qualities a man can't help but fall in love with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-watson><strong>Emma Watson</strong></h2><p>Thanks to the success of the Harry Potter film series, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Watson</a> is a huge celebrity and a very beautiful one indeed. This 27-year-old was born in Paris but grew up in Oxfordshire. Her role in Harry Potter as Hermione Granger was her first ever acting job since she had only been involved in school plays before. She played the part in eight films for 10 years and won numerous accolades, fame, and approximately $60 million.</p><p>Emma has been part of other successful films, including&nbsp;The Perks of Being a Wallflower, The Bling Ring, This Is the End, Noah, and she starred in the musical film Beauty and the Beast. For her work in film, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts honored her in 2014, when she won British Artist of the Year.</p><p>Any Hollywood wife has enough reason to be worried if she hears her husband will act with Emma, because in addition to not having her own husband, she is successful, beautiful, and can get any man she desires.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gal-gadot><strong>Gal Gadot</strong></h2><p>2017 was an exceptional year for lovers of female superheroes because unlike other female superhero films in the past, this year's Wonder Woman film was a huge success. Undoubtedly, one of the major reasons for the film's success was the main character Diana, Princess of the Amazons, a role played by the extremely beautiful <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gal Gadot</a>. This DC Extended Universe film raked in close to $830 million, which was almost as much as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, despite the latter featuring DC's most powerful and most popular superheroes, Batman and Superman.</p><p>Over the years, people have rated Wonder Woman as one of the sexiest female superheroes in all comic book universes, and although most artists have tried to portray this on paper and in animation, Gadot perfectly embodied the character. Wonder Woman is also one of the most powerful female superheroes, and since Gadot is Wonder Woman, most men, including fellow actors, would love an opportunity to date her, though she's married. Gadot is one of the hottest women in Hollywood since her resumé includes being crowned Miss Israel in 2004, and she arguably looks even better today. In addition, she was a soldier in the Israeli Defence Forces for two years, which makes her even more attractive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-jolie><strong>Angelina Jolie</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie</a> is perhaps the oldest woman on this list since she's 42, but she honestly looks like she's in her mid-thirties. Jolie is also arguably the biggest star on this list, although in the recent past, she has been making films as opposed to playing the lead, a role we've grown comfortable seeing her play over the years. Jolie has topped the list of Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, cited as one of the most powerful and influential people in the entertainment industry, and named the most beautiful woman in the world by various media outlets on several occasions.</p><p>Throughout her career, Jolie has received numerous awards and nominations, with the most notable ones being three Golden Globe Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and one Academy Award. Her amazing performances in the films George Wallace, Gia, and Girl, Interrupted&nbsp;earned her the above awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What makes Jolie so dangerous to Hollywood wives is how she broke <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston</a>'s marriage and married Brad, but they're now separated. Jolie can still get any man she wants, and it doesn’t even matter who he is or whether he's married or not.</p><h2 id=rihanna><strong>Rihanna</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna</a> is one of the most successful female musicians since she is one of the best-selling artists ever and still holds the record for the shortest period a young solo artist has ever taken to earn 14 number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>Although Rihanna is most popularly known for her music, she is also a wonderful actress and has appeared in amazing films such as Bring It On: All or Nothing, Battleship, and Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. Audiences are looking forward to her upcoming 2018 film Ocean's Eight,&nbsp;one that we expect will be the best of the Ocean's films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As is the case with all other women on this list, Hollywood wives shouldn't look forward to having their husbands act alongside this beautiful and extremely successful celebrity. She has dated high profile celebrities, and although most of them are musicians, no male actor would have the strength to resist her.</p><h2 id=margot-robbie><strong>Margot Robbie</strong></h2><p>Australian born actress and producer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Margot Robbie</a> might&nbsp;only have been in the industry for&nbsp;eight years, but the impact she has had in these few years is one that will last ages. After her amazing performance in Australia's leading series Neighbours, from which she received two Logie Award nominations, she moved to the United States and her career shot up.</p><p>Most of us remember her outstanding performance in The Wolf of Wall Street, where she played the role of Naomi Lapaglia, the girlfriend and eventual wife of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>'s character. Robbie later appeared in successful films such as Focus, The Big Short, The Legend of Tarzan, and Suic*de Squad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robbie is the sexiest Harley Quinn we've ever seen, and although she was arguably the funniest and most captivating member of the squad, we can't deny most of the attention she received was owing to just how hot she is. Although she's married, no woman wants to take chances letting her husband act alongside Robbie, since after being with her on set, he might never be the same again.</p><h2 id=anna-kendrick><strong>Anna Kendrick</strong></h2><p>Since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna Kendrick</a> began acting on Broadway as a child actor, she has vast experience in the industry. She received a Tony Award nomination in 1998 for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for her performance in High Society. She ventured into film in 2003 and rose to prominence for her role in The Twilight Saga. She has received a lot of love and attention for her starring role in the Pitch Perfect film series, where she plays the role of Beca Mitchell, a role that brings our attention to her beautiful voice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anna Kendrick is a beautiful 32-year-old and a highly talented actress who's not yet married but is dating Ben Richardson, a cinematographer she met on the set of Drinking Buddies. Hollywood wives shouldn't be comfortable with their husbands acting alongside Kendrick because she's really young and beautiful and appears to be very fun to be with.</p><h2 id=nina-dobrev><strong>Nina Dobrev</strong></h2><p>If you're one of those people who look at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nina Dobrev</a> and wonder why she looks so beautiful in a unique way, it's probably because her parents came from Bulgaria, though she grew up in Canada from the age of two. The role she is most famous for was that of Elena Gilbert/Katherine Pierce/Amara in The Vampire Diaries. In the series, she was a nice and relatable "girl next door" type of person, whose encounter with Salvatores flipped her life upside down. Her performance through the 134 episodes from season one to six was exciting since she won numerous awards and nominations for this role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dobrev is clearly one of the most beautiful women on this list, and this means she's one of the most beautiful single ladies in Hollywood, the kind who is a nightmare to many Hollywood wives.</p><h2 id=charlize-theron><strong>Charlize Theron</strong></h2><p>If you love watching movies, chances are you've watched one that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlize Theron</a>&nbsp;has starred in, and you can testify to just how good she is. This beautiful actress was born in South Africa and she became a U.S citizen in 2007. However, she still holds on to her South African citizenship.</p><p>Although so many of her films are amazing, some that truly stand out include The Italian Job, Hancock, Snow White and the Huntsman, Prometheus, A Million Ways to Die in the West, The Fate of the Furious, and Atomic Blonde. For her performance in the 2003 film Monster, she won numerous accolades including a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Actress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Charlize used to be married to Stuart Townsend, but since they went their separate ways back in 2010, no Hollywood wife would want to have her husband acting closely with her. In addition to being so beautiful, Charlize is available and she has what it takes to win over any man.</p><h2 id=rachel-mcadams><strong>Rachel McAdams</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel McAdams</a> is an exceptionally beautiful Canadian actress who began her acting career in Canada between 2001 and 2002 and later made her way to Hollywood. The comedy film The Hot Chick was McAdams' first film in Hollywood, and although she was great in the film, she rose to fame following her amazing performances in the films Mean Girls and The Notebook. The media described McAdams as Hollywood's new "it girl," owing to additional performances in films such as the Wedding Crashers, Red Eye, and The Family Stone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to just how amazing she is as an actress and how beautiful she is, McAdams has dated some great guys over the years. After starring in The Notebook with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Gosling</a>, they two dated for a few years, and of course, the film had a lot to do with their relationship. Since she's not yet married, she can date anyone she wants, and that's what makes her so dangerous to Hollywood wives.</p><h2 id=nicole-beharie><strong>Nicole Beharie</strong></h2><p>The beautiful Nicole Beharie is a wonderful actress and a talented singer who has been involved in several acting projects since her first appearance in Hollywood in 2008. Beharie traveled a lot when she was young, growing up in Jamaica, Nigeria, the United Kingdom, and Panama, thanks to her father's profession in the Foreign Service. Her father is Jamaican and mother is Nigerian, though she is an American.</p><p>Some of her notable roles are in films such as&nbsp;American Violet, My Last Day Without You, Shame, and 42, among other films. On television, she is famous for playing the role of Abbie Mills in Sleepy Hollow, from 2013 to 2016, which is the role most of us remember her from.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beharie is on this list because she is a celebrity on the rise, and sources claim she is single. Hollywood wives don’t like to deal with these attractive new girls because they tend to be fascinating to all the men around them and usually end up dating their costars.</p><h2 id=lupita-nyong-o><strong>Lupita Nyong’o</strong></h2><p>Do these words sounds familiar? “No matter where you’re from, your dreams are valid.” If they do, then you probably watched the 86th Academy Awards or a section of the same, since the above statement is part of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lupita Nyong'o</a>'s acceptance speech after winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.</p><p>The interesting thing about Lupita's win is that she won this prestigious award in her first feature film role after graduating from the Yale School of Drama in the 2013 film 12 Years a Slave. Lupita became the first Kenyan and Mexican to win the prestigious award, and if you've seen her in action, then you know she deserved it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources claim that Lupita has hooked up with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chiwetel Ejiofor</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Fassbender</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">K'Naan</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jared Leto</a> but chances are she's currently single. Lupita is an extremely talented and beautiful woman, who appears as if she can date and get serious with anyone in Hollywood. Therefore, you won't find any Hollywood wife who is fine with her husband working closely with her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2WsLW%2BxKyqnqtdo7xutM6lo7Kvn6SxbsPIn5xmr5GjwbR506GcoqpdncK0rsCnm2asn2KupMCMsKCtoF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
