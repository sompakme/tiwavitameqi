By leveraging the potential that social media has to offer, he has gained over 2 billion views with 5 million subscribers across social media accounts.</p><p>On top of that, he has his own discount <a href=#>business</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>mikzenon.com</a> that helps save others thousands of dollars each year.</p><p>As with any entrepreneurial journey, Mik did not start at the top. In fact, he grew up in one of the poorest neighborhoods in his area. He went on to get a job as a high school teacher and lived a relatively normal life.</p><p>It was at the start of the pandemic that Mik realized that he no longer wanted to be a consumer and instead wanted to be a creator. Around the same time, his daughter was born.</p><p>Despite his life being busier than it had ever been, he started creating content. He comments that the “biggest challenge was creating content while having a newborn and no family presence/help (social distancing was a thing back then).”</p><p>Day in and day out for seven days a week, he pushed on, with little to no sleep. But, it paid off. By the end of 2022, he managed to bring in 15 million in Amazon sales.</p><p>On top of that, he gained around 5 million subscribers across five major social media platforms including <a href=#>Instagram</a> and <a href=#>TikTok</a> as an affiliate marketer. Throughout that time, his content amassed over 2 billion views.</p><p>Mik pioneered a new form of social media affiliate marketing. He explains: “Prior to me, all the content was strictly focused on the product. I added humor and a bit of an edge to my content that is now replicated by other social media affiliate influencers.”</p><p>He also started his own discount business to help American families save thousands of dollars each year. His quick rise to fame brought him a lot of attention including from major sites such as Buzzfeed, Yahoo, and Today.</p><p>Mik was also invited to be a part of the Amazon Home Influencer Program and was a speaker at an Amazon event for other influencers.</p><p>For others who want to turn their lives around like Mik did, he advises:</p><p>Always be a creator of content, not a consumer. No matter what field you are in (teacher, construction worker, amazon warehouse employee, UPS driver, etc.) make sure that you produce content. There is an audience for everyone out there and once you have a large enough audience there are many ways to monetize that.</p><p>He goes on to say: “Once you start creating content, don’t stop. It is only a matter of time before you become successful. It may take 3 months, it may take 10 years, but I guarantee it will be worth it in the end.”</p><p>In other words, wherever you are in life and whatever you are doing, there is an audience for what you do and with hard work and dedication, you can grow and monetize that audience.</p><p>In the future, Mik plans to build a marketing empire on the level of some of the greats that are generating enough capital to build, for example, sports stadiums. He, then, wants to use the money he earns to help others in need.</p><p>Though Mik Zenon’s life started out like most others, he did not let that stop him from rising to the top.</p><p>During the peak of the pandemic and with a newborn baby to care for, instead of delaying or giving up on his plans, he worked seven days a week with little to no sleep to build his wildly successful affiliate marketing empire.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCy0aikZqafqbWqusZmq6hlYWp6rrXLpaCopl2itqx52Z6lqKZdoq6zt8StoKefXZq6sbXRnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
