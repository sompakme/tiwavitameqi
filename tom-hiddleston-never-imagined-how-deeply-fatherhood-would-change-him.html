And yeah, it’s before and after.”</p><p>Ashton, 39, gave birth to <a href=#>their first child</a> together in 2022, Us Weekly confirmed. “Tom and Zawe are loving being new parents and are filled with joy,” a source exclusively told Us at the time. “They have been having the struggles of new parents and aren’t sleeping much but are thrilled.”</p><p>The actress also recently joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe, playing the villainous Dar-Benn in The Marvels, which hit theaters earlier this month.</p><p>“I’m so proud of her yeah, and she’s terrific in the Marvels,” Hiddleston shared during the podcast while discussing trading tips about playing a supervillain. “I just only saw it recently. Yeah, it has been it has been bizarre to to share those stories. I mean, I kind of want her to talk about her own work in her own way, but but yeah, I’m so proud of her. We’ve had some definitely had some laughs along the way about zippers and bathroom breaks.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tom-hiddleston-never-imagined-how-deeply-fatherhood-would-change-him-02.jpg><p>Earlier this month, Hiddleston was asked if Loki and The Marvels connected, given that the finale debuted on Disney+ at the same time the film hit theaters.</p><p>“I mean, there are connections. Some secret, some not-so-secret,” Hiddleston said while on <a href=#>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a>. “I don’t know what the fans think the secret connection is. … My other half is in The Marvels and I’m very proud of her. So there you go.”</p><p>Ashton met Hiddleston in 2018 while they starred on London’s West End in a play called Betrayal alongside Daredevil actor <strong>Charlie Cox</strong>. They brought the show to Broadway in 2019, but their relationship didn’t end there.
