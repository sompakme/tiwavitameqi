Amanda Dawn “Mandy” Gomez, Selena's mom, and Rick met when they were both high school students in Texas. Mandy was reportedly only 16 years old when she gave birth to the pop singer.</p><p>Her parents got a divorce when she was five, so she split her time between living with each of them and with her grandparents. Following their divorce, her parents established separate lives for themselves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Selena has never discussed her father in public, but she did tell PopSugar that she blamed her mother for her parents' split.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1-1.png><p>"I blamed my mom a lot for the divorce because I wanted a family so bad," Selena said. "I wanted to have my mom and dad together. I remember just being angry with my mom. I still feel really bad about that."</p><p>Her mom was trying to make ends meet by working three jobs at once. Yahoo reports that Selena recalls how she and her mother <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dug into couch cushions in search of gas money</a>. After that, they'd take a late-night stroll to the next dollar store to pick up some spaghetti for dinner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Selena Gomez Is Terrified Of Getting Pregnant For This Heartbreaking Reason</a></span></p><p>Talking about Rick Gomez necessitates discussing his relationship with his well-known daughter. It has come to light that Rick did not actively participate in raising his daughter, so the two did not have the close relationship one might expect at the outset.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/3-1.png><p>Years passed with no evidence of communication between the father and daughter, prompting fans to believe that she has <a href=#>a terrible relationship with her parents</a>.</p><p>Rick and Mandy both remarried after their divorces, and Rick's second wife is named Sara Tovar Gomez.

Though there have been some ups and downs, they <a href=#>have a wonderful relationship</a>.</p><p>The pop sensation has discussed the lack of involvement from her father during her formative years. She previously told Rolling Stone, "He didn't want to be a part of this industry life, so it was really me and my mom, our journey."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2-1.png><p>However, she does remember the times spent with him.

Mavis had no idea that it was not fatigue but isolation that her father was feeling. Gomez claimed she had a similar experience with her own father, albeit she was less eager to facilitate a romantic relationship for him than her fictional character.</p><p>"I was very much like, I didn't want anyone with him," Gomez said of herself as a child. She now recognizes that she will always want what is best for her father.</p><h2 id=selena-gomez-rsquo-s-father-appears-to-be-very-proud-of-his-daughter>Selena Gomez’s Father Appears To Be Very Proud Of His Daughter</h2><p>Selena Gomez's father, Ricardo Joel Gomez, may not be seen very often, but he is a dedicated fan who regularly posts Instagrams of himself cheering for his daughter.

He frequently updates his Instagram with new pictures of his three children: youngest daughter Victoria, stepson Marcus, and his original baby girl Selena. A couple of old Selena videos from her Barney and Friends days can be found on his account.</p><p>In 2020, on Selena's birthday, he shared a statement to Instagram in which he said, "You will always be my beautiful little girl. I love you, mija. #happybirthday #godbless #grateful."</p><p>Also in 2018, on Selena’s birthday, Rick wrote, "When I look at you I remember the very moment you were born, and still today when I see you I am reminded what special blessing God has given me." That's the cutest thing ever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He never misses his daughter's birthday and utilizes the occasion to show his pride in her. This is in contrast to her, who has never posted anything for Father's Day or her dad's birthday despite the fact that they are supposed to have a good relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/4-1.png><p>The lack of communication had fans speculating that Selena may be holding resentment towards her parents for <a href=#>possibly breaking up her relationship with Justin Bieber</a>, but this may not be the case.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Selena Gomez Says She's Tired Of Being Haunted By Her Ex In Documentary</a></span></p><p>Her lack of intention towards her dad doesn't mean she doesn't think about him at all.
