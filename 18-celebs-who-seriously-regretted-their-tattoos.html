Tattoos are permanent and will be with you until the day you die. Hopefully, after years go by, you still love that tattoo and won't regret your decision, unlike these eighteen celebrities on this list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These eighteen Hollywood stars got inked and ended up having their tats either totally removed or covered them up with a different tattoo. Denise Richards covered up her ex-husband Charlie Sheen's name with a fairy. Singer Demi Lovato admitted that her spur-of-the-moment decision to get her friend's lips tattooed on her arm was just plain "stupid." And actress Hayden Panettiere embarrassingly forgot to do a proper spell check on her tattoo and ended up getting it removed in 2013.</p><p>Let's take a look at some of our favorite celebrities, from Johnny Depp to Megan Fox, and see which of their tattoos was a painful regret.</p><h2 id=johnny-depp---wino-forever><strong>Johnny Depp - "Wino Forever"</strong></h2><p>Pirates of the Caribbean&nbsp;actor Johnny Depp has a number of tattoos including his first tattoo, which is a profile of a Cherokee Indian chief, his mother's name, Betty Sue, the name of his first born daughter, Lily Rose, the number three, which is reportedly his "magic number," and a sparrow that represents his son, Jack. However, Depp hasn't loved every one of his tats. One in particular is a tattoo above his Indian chief tattoo on his right bicep that used to read "Winona Forever."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Johnny and actress Winona Ryder were engaged back in 1990 and, as a declaration of his love to her, got a tattoo. The relationship didn't last long, and the two split in 1993.</strong></p><p>Depp decided to change his tattoo to say "Wino Forever."</p><h2 id=megan-fox---marilyn-monroe-tattoo-was-too-negative><strong>Megan Fox - Marilyn Monroe Tattoo Was Too Negative</strong></h2><p>Actress Megan Fox is another star that has a number of tattoos, but the one on her forearm was one she just had to completely remove. Fox stated that she had to remove a large tattoo of the image of Marilyn Monroe's face on her forearm because she didn't want to associate herself with some of the Hollywood legend's negative life. Speaking to Esquire in an interview, Fox said,</p><p><strong>"I started reading about her and I realized that her life was incredibly difficult. It's like when you visualize something for your future. I didn't want to visualize something so negative."</strong></p><p>Although, the Transformers actress does believe that Monroe was a great star and a powerful figure in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christina-aguilera---tattoo-meant-something-else><strong>Christina Aguilera - Tattoo Meant Something Else</strong></h2><p>When Christina Aguilera was married to Jordan Bratman, she decided to express her love to him by getting his initials tattooed on the inner part of her left elbow in Hebrew. Unfortunately though, the combination of the letters actually means the number 12 and not her ex-husband's initials, which are "JB." And, the star and her man even split not too long after she decided to get the then-meaningful ink. Now that The Voice judge is divorced from Bratman, she can possibly find some sort of meaning for the number 12. If not, she could always pretend.</p><h2 id=denise-richards---covered-up-ex-husband-s-name><strong>Denise Richards - Covered Up Ex-Husband's Name</strong></h2><p>How many times have we heard that you should never get your boyfriend/girlfriend/ husband/wife's name tattooed on your body? Well, it appears that not even celebrities can follow this important tattoo rule. Stars like Denise Richards thought it was a good idea to get her ex-husband Charlie Sheen's name tattooed on her ankle. Charlie did the same, getting "Denise" tattooed on his wrist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>When the couple decided to split, Sheen had his ink zapped off, while Denise went for a more creative approach.</strong></p><p>With the help of famous tattoo artist Kat Von D, Denise&nbsp;was able to get&nbsp;her ink covered with a fairy.</p><h2 id=pharrell-williams---puts-new-skin-for-tats><strong>Pharrell Williams - Puts New Skin For Tats?</strong></h2><p>Pharrell Williams was sick of all of his tattoos that instead of getting laser tattoo removal, he decided to try this new technology, which involves applying new skin over old body art. Talking about the pricey procedure, the rapper said, "It's basically like getting a skin graft, but your not taking skin from your a** or your legs. These guys actually grow the skin for you."</p><p><strong>As weird as that sounds, it appears that it's actually worked well for the rapper.</strong></p><p>Now with a blank canvas, Pharrell stated, "When it has healed, you can go get whatever tattoo you want." Hopefully, he thinks a lot harder on what to get for his next one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=marc-anthony---couldn-t-be-reminded-of-marriage-to-j-lo><strong>Marc Anthony - Couldn't Be Reminded Of Marriage To J-Lo</strong></h2><p>Marc Anthony is another star who thought his relationship would last until the end of time. Sadly, he and megastar Jennifer Lopez couldn't make their marriage work, even after having twins Max and Emme. Anthony got J-Lo's name tattooed on his wrist when they were an item.</p><p><strong>After the split, he quickly covered up his ex's name with some sort of large symbol.</strong></p><p>Reportedly, Anthony also had a tattoo that had Jennifer Lopez's initials on his left ring finger. This guy needs a lesson or two on not getting women's names on his body (especially more than once). It is permanent, Marc!</p><h2 id=angelina-jolie---so-long-billy-bob><strong>Angelina Jolie - So Long, Billy Bob</strong></h2><p>Angelina Jolie has a total of twenty tattoos. The actress' tattoos include a Tennessee Williams quote, a Buddhist prayer, Arabic script meaning "Determination," and gothic lettering reading "Know Your Rights" just to name a few. Jolie pretty much loves getting tattoos. However, the one of her ex's name just had to go. Jolie removed her "Billy Bob" tattoo, which was on her arm and</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>replaced it with the coordinates of her six children's birthplaces.</strong></p><p>Angelina added a seventh line of coordinates for her ex-husband Brad Pitt's place of birth in Oklahoma. We'll have to check up on the actress to see if she'll have that line removed for good now that her and Pitt have gone their separate ways.</p><h2 id=eva-longoria---had-to-get-three-tattoos-of-ex-husband-removed><strong>Eva Longoria - Had To Get Three Tattoos Of Ex-Husband Removed</strong></h2><p>When actress Eva Longoria was married to NBA player Tony Parker, she got, not one, not two, but three tattoos for him and their marriage. There was the tattoo of Parker's number, a tat of their wedding date, and one of his initials. Longoria underwent tattoo removal treatments for all three of her mistakes. The couple was married for three years until the actress discovered Parker's infidelity. It was reported that&nbsp;the basketball star was caught exchanging hundreds (that's right, hundreds) of text messages with a former San Antonio Spurs teammate's wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amber-rose---had-to-cover-portrait-of-wiz-khalifa><strong>Amber Rose - Had To Cover Portrait Of Wiz Khalifa</strong></h2><p>While getting an ex's name tattooed is quite silly (yet so many people are doing it), getting a portrait of the man you're with just sounds so insane. Amber Rose had her ex rapper boyfriend Wiz Khalifa's portrait tattooed on the back of her arm (and as you can see in the image above, it was not so subtle). Once the two called it quits in 2014,</p><p><strong>Rose was apparently covering his face with pictures of roses.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Amber had enough of seeing her ex on her arm and decided to cover it up with a portrait of what looks like rocker Slash. Hey, maybe she's a Guns N' Roses fan...</p><h2 id=nick-cannon---covered-huge-tat-with-another-massive-one><strong>Nick Cannon - Covered Huge Tat With Another Massive One</strong></h2><p>We were all a little bit confused when Nick Cannon covered up his already huge Mariah tattoo on his back with a more massive crucifixion tattoo. Of course, his Mariah tat was for his ex-wife, Mariah Carey, with whom he has two children named Moroccan and Monroe. There was speculation that the two had called it quits, but when Cannon was out shirtless and his Mariah tattoo was visibly&nbsp;completely gone, we all sort of knew that the marriage was like officially over.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=demi-lovato---made-a-stupid-mistake><strong>Demi Lovato - Made A "Stupid" Mistake</strong></h2><p>Demi Lovato has a bunch of tattoos, but the only one she called a "stupid" mistake was a tattoo of her friend's lips on the inside of her forearm. During an appearance on LIVE! With Kelly and Michael, the singer admitted that</p><p><strong>she is starting to regret getting 12 tattoos when she was a teenager and pointed to the lips on her arm.</strong></p><p>Lovato also called getting the tat, a "spur of the moment" decision. The singer has a total of twenty tattoos, including a lion's face on her hand, a dream catcher on her side, a smiley face on the inside of the tip of her pinkie finger, and a tattoo of Africa on the inside of her elbow, just to name a few.</p><h2 id=hayden-panettiere---should-have-done-a-spell-check><strong>Hayden Panettiere - Should Have Done A Spell Check</strong></h2><p>Nashville star Hayden Panettiere had the phrase "Live without regrets" tattooed on her side in Italian. However, her one big regret is that she didn't properly check the spelling of her tattoo before having it permanently inked on her skin. The words "Vivere senza rimpianti" were tattooed on her left rib cage,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>but the last word should be spelled "rimipianti."</strong></p><p>The actress said she got the tattoo, thanks to her dad, "He said, 'Whenever one door closes, another one always opens.' So my tattoo means 'Live without regrets.'" She also joked that about the misspelling, stating, "It's misspelled too, so I literally have to live by that advice!" Hayden did get the tattoo removed in 2013.</p><h2 id=kelly-osbourne---painfully-removing-all-15-tattoos><strong>Kelly Osbourne - Painfully Removing All 15 Tattoos</strong></h2><p>Kelly Osbourne is no stranger to tattoos, but in 2013, the&nbsp;Fashion Police&nbsp;co-host was saying goodbye to her tats—all 15 of them. The star began doing tattoo laser removal on her keyboard tattoo located on her right forearm and even showed her fans the painful process of removal on her Instagram. Kelly mentioned that she was saying goodbye to her keyboard tattoo first because she actually had no idea why she got it since she doesn't even play the keyboard. While she will leave some of her tattoos, like the matching one she has with her brother, Jack, the star wants the others to go.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"[Getting them removed] will take several months, and while I'm not looking forward to the pain, I've heard it hurts less than getting a tattoo. I hope so,"</strong></p><p>Kelly said.</p><h2 id=adrienne-bailon---regrets-her-rob-kardashian-tattoo><strong>Adrienne Bailon - Regrets Her Rob Kardashian Tattoo</strong></h2><p>Former Cheetah Girl Adrienne Bailon admitted on the talk show The Real that she really regretted getting Rob Kardashian's name tattooed on her butt. The two stars dated from 2007 to 2009 but ended their relationship when Rob admitted to cheating.</p><p><strong>"It's awful. Ten-letter last name, 'Kardashian.' It's pretty bad. Now that is a ratchet tattoo. I made a very bad decision. Don't follow my example,"</strong></p><p>she said, adding that she was in process of getting it removed. "You can smell your flesh burning, and it's my a** flesh burning. All bad ... Booty tattoos, names of other men: ratchet. Don't do it!" In an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Rob revealed that he got Adrienne's name tattooed on his rib cage. We're pretty sure that's all covered up by now, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-arnold---put-roseanne-barr-s-face-on-his-chest><strong>Tom Arnold - Put Roseanne Barr's Face On His Chest</strong></h2><p>Like Amber Rose, actor Tom Arnold thought it was a terrific idea to get his ex-wife Roseanne Barr's face tattooed on his chest. He allegedly got the tattoo to save their marriage, which was crumbling.</p><p><strong>"On Valentine's Day that year, I said I'm going to save the marriage and got a twelve-hour tattoo of her face on my chest,"</strong></p><p>Arnold said, adding, "Stupidest thing I ever did. I thought 'this is going to save everything.' And all it did was cause me more heartache, because I had to go get laser (removal).'" Arnold admitted that it took a year and a half to completely come off, but it was worth it in the end.</p><h2 id=blake-shelton---forearm-tattoo-not-lady-bugs><b>Blake Shelton -&nbsp;Forearm </b><b>Tattoo</b><b>&nbsp;(Not Lady Bugs)</b></h2><p>Country star Blake Shelton knows that his tattoo on his arm is "crappy." Shelton has a tattoo around his left forearm that is supposed to be deer tracks representing his love of deer hunting. However, the deer tracks constantly get mistaken for lady bugs. The singer thought he'd make his tattoo manlier by adding a coil of barbed wire, but that just made things look even worse. Shelton admitted, "I probably have the crappiest tattoo, not only in country music, but maybe in the world."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=melanie-griffith---removed-ex-husband-s-name-after-18-years-of-marriage><strong>Melanie Griffith - Removed Ex-Husband's Name After 18 Years Of Marriage</strong></h2><p>After 18 years of marriage to Antonio Banderas, actress Melanie Griffith had to remove the one thing that was going to constantly remind her of the couple's split—her tattoo of his name in a heart on her arm. In 2014, Griffith began her laser removal process, slowly removing the very prominent tattoo. Before getting it removed, Griffith was reportedly spotted trying to cover up her tat with a large bandage (but she wasn't fooling anyone, obviously). When will celebs ever learn that it’s never okay to get a lover’s name inked on their skin, no matter how much money they have?</p><h2 id=mark-wahlberg---had-kids-watch-his-tattoo-laser-removal-to-scare-them><strong>Mark Wahlberg - Had Kids Watch His Tattoo Laser Removal To Scare Them</strong></h2><p>Actor Mark Wahlberg hated his tattoos so much that he apparently took his own kids to watch him get them lasered off. In 2012, Wahlberg decided that it was time to remove his half a dozen or so tattoos and brought along his children to discourage them from ever getting any ink themselves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I don't want my kids getting tattoos," he said about his three children,</strong></p><p>adding, "I've taken my two older kids to the procedure so they see how painful it is and what I have to go through." Some of the tattoos he was removing included a Sylvester the cat and Tweety Bird on his ankle, Bob Marley tattoo, and One Love on his left arm. Quite an unusual combination.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYW16pLHLnpmsZaedvG6%2FxKugqK2jocZuvsSgqZ6spJqxbsDHnqCrZaSWwbW7zqxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
