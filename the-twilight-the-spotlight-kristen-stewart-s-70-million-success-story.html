The then-future star began her successful <a href=#>acting career at a young age</a>, starting off by auditioning for roles on the Disney channel.&nbsp; Her perseverance yielded, and she had her big break as Jodie Foster’s daughter in the Panic Room. Her role as Bella Swan in the <i>Twilight Saga</i> surged her fame and wealth as well, as <a href=#>the movie was a blockbuster</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress then challenged herself to step out of her comfort zone as ‘Bella Swan’ and started taking up versatile roles. As a result, Kristen has earned multiple awards and accolades. She has also broken records and been on <a href=#>the list of the highest-paid actresses</a>. Recently, Stewart has also been practicing the art of direction, and some of her projects have already been released.</p><p>Here is a glimpse at how Stewart rose to fame and grew her massive wealth of $70 million.</p><h2 id=early-life-and-career-as-a-young-artist>Early Life And Career As A Young Artist</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kristen Stewart was born to parents who were <a href=#>both in the show business</a>. Her mother, Jules Mann-Stewart, was a director and script supervisor, while her father, John Stewart, was a producer and stage manager. She was born in Los Angeles, California, in 1990. Interestingly, she did not have early aspirations to grow up and become an actress. However, the influence of being in a family that was so closely associated with the entertainment industry eventually brought out her hidden passion. After which, she was trained for a few years to become a performer.</p><p>She then began auditioning for different roles and succeeded in landing a few small roles in television programs. Stewart finally got the chance to play Jodie Foster’s daughter, Sarah Altman, in the David Fincher thriller movie called <i>Panic Room</i>, which was released in 2002. It also earned her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of her first award nominations as a young artist</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Two years later, when Kristen was hardly 14 years old, she acted in another remarkable Catch That Kid movie. She earned critical acclaim for her next film called Speak and acted in movies like <i>Zathura: A Space Adventure</i>, directed by Jon Favreau. Likewise, <i>Fierce People, The Messengers, Into the Wild, Jumper</i>, and <i>What Just Happened&nbsp;</i><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">were some of her other works</a>.</p><h2 id=getting-launched-in-the-hollywood-industry>Getting Launched In The Hollywood Industry</h2><p>Stewart’s dreams came true in 2007 when she got cast as the lead in <a href=#><i>The Twilight Saga</i></a>, accompanied by co-star Robert Pattinson. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The movie grossed over $700 million</a> at the box office, turning Kristen into one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood. In the beginning, Stewart and Pattinson earned about $2 million each from Twilight, but with the rising popularity and release of new movies in the franchise, their earnings increased from $12 million to $25 million. After a point, Kristen realized that she must branch out as the audience may not be able to imagine her as anyone other than Bella Swan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Screen Princess: The Anne Hathaway Route To $60 Million</a></span></p><h2 id=career-beyond-the-twilight-trilogy>Career Beyond The Twilight Trilogy</h2><p>While working in the <i>Twilight </i>movies, Stewart simultaneously worked on other projects like<i> The Runaways, Adventureland, and Welcome to the Rileys.</i> In 2012, she became part of <a href=#>another famous movie franchise</a>, called <i>Snow White and the Huntsman</i>. Stewart starred as Snow White alongside Chris Hemsworth, who played the Huntsman. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She earned a mind-blowing $9.5 million</a> of the project.</p><p>Following this, Kristen decided to act in independent movies and show her prowess as a versatile actress in the industry. 2017 was a crucial year for her as she began trying her hand at directing films instead of being in them; her directorial debut came with a movie called <i>Come Swim</i>. In 2019 she returned to play a character in a mainstream Hollywood movie called <i>Charlie’s Angels</i>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=income-from-endorsement-deals>Income From Endorsement Deals</h2><p>Kristen Stewart has also earned big bucks by <a href=#>signing certain endorsement deals</a> with prestigious brands like Balenciaga. She has also been the face of Chanel for more than seven years now.</p><p>Kristen, however, turned down a deal offered by Nike as she did not want too much attention to herself. Looking at the fact that Stewart prefers comfortable footwear over fancy heels, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nike had tried to sign a deal with her</a>, but Stewart was pretty self-conscious about seeing her face on too many products.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apart from these, Stewart is known to spend lavishly on real estate and is also a philanthropist. The actress has always stood up for the LGBTQ community by being a representative herself. Although Stewart prefers a grounded and private lifestyle, she has spent generously on real estate purchases. She is known to have bought a mansion in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, a $5.6 million loft in New York City, and a $4.8 million house in Malibu, which she later tried selling for $9.5 million.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Ways Sandra Bullock Earns And Spends Her Fortune</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wealthy Genius</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Things</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wealthy Gorilla</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mail Online</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4s7XSrZynZaOpsrit0a1kcGhdoratuMiopWarpZiwpr%2FSZqqtp6KufA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
