"I've never thought about that ... I can't even remember what happens in the film."</p><p>However, his lack of memory shouldn't be interpreted as lack of enthusiasm; he then added, "It's so long since I've seen it. You'd have to remind me. How do I end up?"</p><p>To be fair, the movie did come out 18 years ago, and since then, Grant has gone on to star in numerous movies, including, Music and Lyrics, The Gentlemen, and Florence Foster Jenkins.</p><p>Not remembering the plot doesn't mean that he doesn't remember the filming process, however; Grant has talked about the movie several times, especially his iconic dance scene where he busts a move throughout 10 Downing Street.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview in 2019</a>, he said, "I thought, 'That's going to be excruciating, and it has the power to be the most excruciating scene ever committed to celluloid.'
