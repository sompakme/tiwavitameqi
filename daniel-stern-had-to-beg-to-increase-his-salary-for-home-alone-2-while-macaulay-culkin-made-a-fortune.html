Thanks to how successful Home Alone was, the movie's star, Macaulay Culkin, became one of Hollywood's biggest stars. Of course, by the early 1990s, Joe Pesci was also a superstar thanks to movies like Raging Bull, Lethal Weapon 2, Goodfellas, and My Cousin Vinny.</p><p>Thanks to Culkin and Pesci's vaunted place in Hollywood, they were offered a lot of money to star in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. However, as a May 2024 Daily Mail article which cited his memoir revealed, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Stern had to fight to get the pay raise he knew he deserved</a></strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/th-image-template-9-2.jpg><p>In Stern's book, he revealed <strong>Culkin was being paid $5 million for Home Alone 2</strong>, and he would receive 5% of the movie's profits. Stern went on to explain in his memoir that <strong>Pesci was paid between $2 million and $3 million</strong> with him also getting a percentage of the profits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>How successful were Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, according to The Numbers?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Home Alone's Production Budget:</p></td><td><p>$15,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Home Alone's Worldwide Box Office:</p></td><td><p>$476,680,641</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York's Production Budget:</p></td><td><p>$20,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York's Worldwide Box Office:</p></td><td><p>$358,994,850</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>How Much More Did Home Alone Make At The Box Office Than Home Alone 2: Lost in New York:</p></td><td><p>$117,685,791</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Despite those impressive figures, 20th Century Fox only <strong>offered Stern $600,000 to return for Home Alone's sequel</strong>. Stern's memoir revealed that would have been twice the money that he was paid to star in Home Alone.</p><p>It is also worth noting that if he'd accepted the first deal, <strong>Stern wouldn't have gotten any of the profits</strong> Home Alone 2: Lost in New York made. Worse yet, Stern revealed that the studio waited six months to even offer him that much money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:25</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_why-kieran-culkin-feels-bad-for-his-brother-s-fame_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Kieran Culkin Felt Bad For Macaulay Culkin's Early Fame, Realizing The Dark Side To Being A Child Star">Kieran Culkin Felt Bad For Macaulay Culkin's Early Fame, Realizing The Dark Side To Being A Child Star</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Macaulay and Kieran Culkin were both child stars, but Kieran recognized Macaulay's level of fame had a darkness to it.</p><p>In Stern's book, he describes asking the studio about <strong>how much money Pesci was being paid</strong>. "I asked if that was the same as Joe [Pesci] was getting, and they said it was not."</p><p>After the studio confirmed how much more his co-stars would be making, Stern decided to demand more. However, Stern says his agent told him to take the studio's first offer. In response to that advise, <strong>Stern decided to fire his agent</strong> and explained his reasoning in his book.</p><p>In his book, Stern admitted that asking for more money was the "prideful thing to do". Still, he concluded that if his agent wanted to take the first offer, "then he wasn't very good at his job".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Daniel-Stern-home-alone.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Stern demanded a pay raise for Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. the studio offered him a substantial amount more. <strong>Fox's second offer gave Stern a $200,000 raise</strong>, which meant he would have been paid $800,000.</p><p>Still, that wasn't good enough for Stern because of what he knew about Pesci's salary.

He believed Fox needed him to make Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. However, Stern admits in his memoir that <strong>he was worried about missing out on making the deal</strong>.</p><p>"I knew they couldn't do the movie without me, but I was also insecure, since I almost blew it the first time,' he said about how he almost blundered his casting in the first film.
