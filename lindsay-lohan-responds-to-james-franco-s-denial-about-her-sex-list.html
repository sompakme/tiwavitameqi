During an interview with the <a href=# rel=noopener>UK’s Daily Mail</a>, the actress admitted the experience was “really violating.”</p><p>“I had some friends over that I probably should have questioned a bit but I don’t like to see the bad in people, I like to see the good, so I ignored it and then someone must have stolen it and that’s a really personal thing, that’s something I would never do to anyone,” the 28-year-old said.</p><p>“…That’s something that is uncomfortable to have to say to anyone, let alone for it to be posted everywhere,” she added. “So it’s not a joke, it wasn’t funny, it was cruel. It’s bad karma for whoever did it. It was sh—y.”</p><p>The list of Lohan’s alleged 36 partners included stars such as <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>James Franco</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Justin Timberlake</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Orlando Bloom</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Adam Levine</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Heath Ledger</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Zac Efron</strong></a>. She later confirmed writing the list during Watch What Happens Live’s Plead the Fifth on April 18.</p><p>“You know what? I’m going to get serious for a second,” <a href=# rel=noopener>she said at the time.</a> “That was actually my fifth step in AA at Betty Ford [Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Center]. Someone, when I was moving during the OWN show, must have taken a photo of it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Franco later denied</a> that he ever slept with the Mean Girls alum in an interview with Los Angeles magazine. He also wrote a short story for Vice in which the narrator spends the night with a fictional celeb named “Lindsay” — but doesn’t have sex with her.</p><p>Lohan’s response? “If someone wants to do that for their own reasons, there’s nothing to say, I’m not in their head. [However] I would never do that. I didn’t read it,” she told Daily Mail. “When I started working we didn’t have Twitter, we didn’t have any of this s–t, it’s a different world now. We didn’t have Instagram, we didn’t have camera phones for God’s sake. It’s really different now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaloZ6ZwKLFjKWmoZmeYr%2Bmv8%2BopZ2rXam8brbAppysZZanrq%2BvzqxknZ2enq6tecCbpq6sXZ2ys3nSnq9mpJmowW5%2Bj2pram5oZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
