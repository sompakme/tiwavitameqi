Swift began competing in karaoke contests at the age of 10 and learned the guitar at 12.</p><p>After her family relocated to Tennessee so she could pursue music, Swift was discovered at a cafe and was offered a record deal. Her first single, “<a href=#>Tim McGraw</a>,” peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard charts and served as the lead track for her thrice Platinum-selling self-titled debut album, released in 2006.</p><p>Swift gradually shifted her sound from country to pop and released four more albums — Fearless in 2008, Speak Now in 2010, Red in 2012 and 1989 in 2014. The enormous success of the latter three earned her a world record as the first act to have three million-selling weeks on the Billboard 200 albums chart.</p><p>After a brief hiatus from the spotlight, she dropped her Reputation album in 2017. She released Lover two years later, which she followed up with two surprise albums in 2020, Folklore and Evermore. Swift released her 10th studio album, Midnights, in October 2022.</p><p>Through the years, Swift has won 12 Grammys and was honored in the Songwriters Hall of Fame. She was also the star of her own documentary, Miss Americana, which premiered on Netflix in 2020.</p><p>Swift released her first rerecorded album, Fearless (Taylor’s Version) in April 2021. The project began following a dispute with <a href=#><strong>Scooter Braun</strong></a> over his purchase of the rights to her masters for more than $300 million from Big Machine Records’ <strong>Scott Borchetta</strong>. She went on to release Red (Taylor’s Version) and Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) in November 2021 and July 2023, respectively. The latter helped her break the record for the most No. 1 albums by a woman. Swift officially announced 1989 (Taylor’s Version) at her final Eras Tour concert in Los Angeles in August 2023.</p><p>Swift has been romantically associated with many high-profile men, including <a href=#><strong>Joe Jonas</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Taylor Lautner</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jake Gyllenhaal</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>John Mayer</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Harry Styles</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Calvin Harris</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong></a>, and has often written about her relationships in her songs.</p><p>In 2017, Swift began dating English actor <a href=#><strong>Joe Alwyn</strong></a>. The pair kept their relationship as private as possible, with Swift revealing in 2020 that her then-boyfriend helped her cowrite songs on both Folklore and Evermore amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Us confirmed their split in April 2023.</p><p>Swift went on to briefly date The 1975’s <a href=#><strong>Matty Healy</strong></a> before being linked to Kansas City Chiefs tight end <a href=#><strong>Travis Kelce</strong></a> in September 2023.</p><span>More ▾</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxnpJbGrbvRZqqwoZapfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
