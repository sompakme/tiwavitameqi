Even with his beloved albums and singles, Charlie Puth is still dreadfully underrated. Especially when compared to Swift herself.</p><p>Taylor Swift's 11th studio album, "Tortured Poets Department" debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 on April 19th, 2024. According to Forbes, the album broke a number of records.

Puth admitted this in a TikTok video on May 3rd, 2024. In it, <strong>he said, "These last couple weeks have been really crazy for obvious reasons." </strong>Puth then revealed that he was releasing the first single of his latest album. Soon after, he dropped, "Hero".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/charlie-puth-1.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The concept of Charlie Puth's "Hero"</a></strong> may not have directly come from Taylor Swift's "Tortured Poets Department", but his announcement did include a reference to her.

He stated that <strong>the attention Swift brought him encouraged him to release the song</strong> about a friend named, "Hero".</p><p>"Sometimes I get a little nervous being overly honest in my music which is why this was sitting on my hard drive for a while. But I think someone out there was giving me a sign that I needed to release it."</p><p>In his 2024 interview with Vulture, Charlie Puth went on to praise Taylor Swift for giving him a shout-out and inspiring him to release "Hero".</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/taylor-swift-s-decision-to-re-record-her_gr-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift’s Decision To Re-Record Her Old Songs Impacted Her Net Worth Five Years Later">Taylor Swift’s Decision To Re-Record Her Old Songs Impacted Her Net Worth Five Years Later</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift re-recorded her old songs to gain ownership, and this big decision reflected in her fortune.</p><p>"One of the reasons why I got really excited when Taylor literally wrote my name in her song, I had made “Hero” three weeks before that had happened. And I was kind of unsure about it. Do people want to hear this from me? Or do they want to just have the straightaway pop banger that everybody can listen to? Which is fine. But I wanted to get a little more specific lyrically, and she’s definitely one of the best at that, if not the best. I was inspired by that. When she shouted me out, I was like, “I should probably put the song out that kind of takes that formula a bit.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=does-charlie-puth-agree-with-taylor-swift-39-s-lyrics-in-tortured-poets-department>Does Charlie Puth Agree With Taylor Swift's Lyrics In Tortured Poets Department?</h3><p>Charlie Puth addressed Taylor Swift's "Tortured Poets Department" claim about his career during an interview with Vulture. When asked about whether he agrees that he should be a "bigger artist", the "See You Again" singer said the following:</p><p>"If me being a bigger artist means I get to have even further reach than I already do to tell people to pick up an instrument and make a song and not be discouraged if someone in their life is telling them that they can’t make any art. If it means I can reach ten more people, then I would like to be a bigger artist. <strong>I don’t want to be a bigger artist to inflate my own ego</strong>.

I don’t need someone to preach to me right now.' A.k.a., I don’t need a hero. I wanted it to feel like, 'I have to have an uncomfortable conversation with you.' But I’m not going to say, “I want to be there for you.' It’s going to be, 'I want to stop by and play it cool.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Charlie Puth knows that "Hero" has a chorus that's "hooky".

Of course, I want them to like it, but I’d like them to be unsure of how they feel about it. It’s not anything I’ve ever done before, and I’m not working with different producers. I’m the producer.
