This is definitely not your average meditation session, but you'll laugh so hard that you're likely to instantly feel better.</p><h2 id=comedic-meditation>Comedic Meditation</h2><p>When most people think of meditation, they imagine nature sounds, as a waterfall hits the rocks and soothes the souls of its peaceful listeners. Birds chirp pleasantly, and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">meditation technique helps clear your mind of stresses</a>, anxiety, and to-do lists. Pure solitude and quiet focus is what most meditation entails.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not in Kevin Hart's world, though.</p><p>His meditation involves sarcastic comedy that will have participants keeled over with laughter and feeling more at ease after hearing his hysterical stories about the weird thoughts that invade his mind.</p><p>Paired up with Headspace, and joined by his celebrity comedy-pals, Hart gives meditation a whole new twist, and it's one that you definitely won't want to miss!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Get Sneak Peek Of Kevin Hart's Podcast With Jerry Seinfeld</a></span></p><h2 id=the-laughter-will-definitely-help>The Laughter Will Definitely Help</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This may not be your conventional meditation method, but if you're hoping to forget about your troubles for a while and laugh a little in the face of adversity, it will definitely work for you. Hart hysterically outlines the thoughts that go through his head as he goes for a run and explores his meditation techniques, and they include the funniest, most obscure topics.</p><p>He thinks about whether dogs can talk, ponders how he'll deal with his son being taller than he is, and his&nbsp;wildly funny thoughts&nbsp;include the reminder for himself to change the air filter in his home. It appears that meditation isn't quite his forte.</p><p>Fans are all-in for this. They seem to love the idea of Hart partnering with Headspace, and have commented on his Instagram page to say that this is exactly what they "need right now."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Respond To Kevin Hart's Huge New Role In 'Borderlands', The Movie</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinq6Zo3qprdGtZJqmlGK1qr%2BMnKamnZSerq95xaugnqaUqHq4rc2tZLKnpWLBsHnMnpuirJGpsm7DyK2fZqyYmrpw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
