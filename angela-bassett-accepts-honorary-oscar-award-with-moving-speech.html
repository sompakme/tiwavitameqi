She began her speech by thanking her family, her team, her costars, and more before diving into the historical significance of the award.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I have considered acting my calling and not just my career. I do this work because I find it meaningful, and I hope in some way it makes a difference and has an impact. To be recognized in this way for what I love doing is truly wonderful, and I am beyond grateful,” detailed Bassett before quoting Lena Horne.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I have had to let it sink in that I am the second Black actress to receive an honorary Oscar, the first being my dear friend and mentor, the late Cicely Tyson in 2018. Having a chance to work with and learn from Ms. Tyson is one of the most memorable and treasured experiences of my career and life,&nbsp; and I hope that she is smiling from the heavens that I’m able to join her in this circle of recognition knowing that she was so impactful to me as an actress and as a woman.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1913166102.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Her speech continued to recognize every Black actress who has won an Oscar in a competitive acting category. Bassett began with reference to <a href=#>Hattie McDanie</a>l, the first to win in 1940, describing the historic moment as “making it possible for Black actresses to be seen.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“And it would be another 50 years that another Black woman would win an Oscar, that extraordinary woman being my dear sister-friend Whoopi [Goldberg],” the <a href=#>What’s Love Got To Do With It</a> star continued.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“And still, more than a decade before the next historical milestone with Halle’s [Berry] win as Best Actress, which for more than two decades remains the only. We have Jennifer [Hudson], Mo’nique, Octavia [Spencer], Lupita [Nyong’o], Viola [Davis], Regina [King], and Arianna [Debose]. 10 actresses who are makers of history in our industry. I call their names to acknowledge every one of them this evening for being beacons of possibility and hope for little Black and brown girls who aspire to one day pursue the dream of becoming an actor.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1921304261.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The New York native continued to share a deep message before an enthusiastic close.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“This honor isn’t just for or about me. What I hope this moment means is that we are taking the necessary steps toward a future in which it is the norm, not the exception, to see and embrace one another’s full humanity, stories, and perspectives. This must be our goal, and to always remember that there is room for us all. When we stand together, we win together. To all my fellow Black actresses, fill your hearts with courage and strength, because regardless of what you may think or see or feel, our contributions do matter. Remember who you are, and how our ancestors intended us to be.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch Angela Bassett’s full acceptance speech at the Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&nbsp;14th Governors Awards above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a7qLHLmmSbmaOosrXAjKGmp6eilr%2B6ec6smpqqo2KupK%2FEqauappOaerS8xJ6aoWVhZ4B1hJJyaGlpXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
