It was sad to hear that John and Anna Marie Tendler were getting divorced, and then the news of John and Olivia's love story broke, complicating the entire situation. It's not possible to see your ex dating another person so soon after breaking up with you and not feel anything, right? What if that person is a famous actress who is getting lots of media attention because now she's pregnant (or has just given birth)?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While John and Olivia's love story has moved forward, they don't seem to have discussed marriage, at least not in any interviews. Fans are definitely wondering if the comedian will walk down the aisle for a second time. Will John Mulaney ever get married again? Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=what-has-john-mulaney-said-about-marriage>What Has John Mulaney Said About Marriage?</h2><p>Fans have been following John Mulaney's comedic career for years, from his <a href=#>2018 hosting of Saturday Night Live</a> to his various <a href=#>Netflix</a> specials.</p><p>Since John Mulaney and Annamarie Tendler were married for six years, fans might expect him and Olivia Munn to get married soon. After all, since he was married once before, it would suggest that he would be okay with getting married a second time. But of course, fans don't know what will happen as John and Olivia haven't said anything about this topic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Mulaney did talk about Annamarie Tendler</a> in his The Comeback Kid Netflix special. According to Nicki Swift, "I love saying 'my wife.' It sounds so adult. 'That's my wife.' It's great, you sound like a person. I said it even before we were married. Being married is so nice. I never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself. That's not really a joke, that's just a little sweet thing I like to say."</p><p>Based on that statement, fans could guess that John Mulaney would want to be married a second time. But fans could also say that because he is getting divorced, he and Olivia might want to stay unmarried but in a serious relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Olivia Munn Dated Before Her Pregnancy With John Mulaney</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-long-have-john-mulaney-and-olivia-munn-been-dating>How Long Have John Mulaney And Olivia Munn Been Dating?</h2><p>While John Mulaney and Olivia Munn are in a serious relationship, they aren't engaged, and neither one has spoken to the press about getting engaged or married.</p><p>Olivia Munn has spoken about people wanting to know exactly when they began seeing each other.</p><p>Fans are curious about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">details of Olivia Munn and John Mulaney's relationship</a> and as Page Six reported, Olivia said that she wouldn't go into detail.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A source explained to Page Six that people believe that John was already seeing Olivia when he was still married. The source said, “I don’t think it’s any coincidence that John broke the news of Olivia’s pregnancy the way he did in terms of basically giving a timeline of his past few months — when he moved out of his house, how it was the spring when he fell in love with Olivia. It seems to me that he is going to great lengths to dispute the idea that he cheated.”</p><p>Olivia said, “For whatever reason, it’s easier to blame me. The only way to win, for me, is to pull back and to not play the game at all."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did John Mulaney Just Defend His Romance With Olivia Munn?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-john-mulaney-said-about-becoming-a-dad>What John Mulaney Said About Becoming A Dad</h2><p>It's interesting to note that before becoming romantically involved with Olivia Munn, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Mulaney wasn't interested in children</a>.</p><p>According to Entertainment Weekly, he talked about his show John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch which had a target audience of little ones.

They believe they’re adults. I’d talk to them and they’d say ‘Why don’t you want kids?’ I’d say ‘They’re great, but I love what I do. And I love my wife and spending so much time with her and we have a really fortunate life. I get to travel, do stand-up, and our relationship is so wonderful.
