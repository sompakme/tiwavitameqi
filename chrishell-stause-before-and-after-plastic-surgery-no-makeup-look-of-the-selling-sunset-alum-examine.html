People even claim she looks completely different when she has no makeup.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p>Netflix’s <span><span>Selling Sunset</span></span>, created by <span>Adam DiVello</span>, is one of the most popular reality shows, combining real estate and drama in a way that few can resist. The Oppenheim Group’s various employees are based in Los Angeles, California, and they undoubtedly face numerous personal and professional challenges that frequently pit them against one another. The recently released seventh season of the series is no exception, providing viewers with even more entertainment.</p><p>Since the release of the new season, <span><span>Chrishell Stause</span></span>, one of the cast, has fascinated many viewers with her stunning appearance. She has been in the entertainment industry for over a decade, and her fandom has seen changes in her appearance over time. Although the <span><span>TV star</span></span> is open about her <span>breast implants</span>, fans are curious if she has had any other plastic surgery. Well, here is what we know about her transformation.</p><p>You might also like to read the&nbsp;<span><span>plastic surgery</span></span> story of <span><span>Eric Trump</span></span> and <span><span>Nicole Young.</span></span></p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Did Chrishell Stause From Selling Sunset Undergo Plastic Surgery?

Before and After Photos Examined!<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fans of <span>Selling Sunset</span> have noticed that <span>Chrishell Stause</span> (<span>@chrishell.stause</span>) looks very different when has no makeup put on. For example, her lips appear a little fuller. She is nearly 40 years old, but her skin is as youthful and glowing as it can be. As a result, viewers suspect she has undergone numerous plastic surgery procedures in order to enhance her stunning facial appearance.</p><p>According to reports, the reality star may have received a <span>lip lift</span>&nbsp;in addition to <span>breast enlargement</span>. After comparing her before and after photos, A surgeon at&nbsp;MYA Cosmetic Surgery <span>explained</span>,</p><p><span><span>I believe that Chrishell may have undergone the non-surgical treatment of fillers to her lips, as she appears to have fuller lips compared to previous images, especially when smiling. The provider has ensured Chrishell’s lips still appear natural and in proportion to her other facial features.</span></span></p><p>This procedure can cost anywhere between <span>$261</span> and<span> $1,300</span> per treatment. However, the cost is also determined by the provider and the amount of filler desired.&nbsp; Likely, the surgeon also suggests that Chrishell Stause may have received, “anti-wrinkle injections, often referred to as Botox, to her forehead and around her eyes (crow’s feet). This non-surgical treatment will create a smooth forehead and limit any frown/expression lines.”</p><p>Plastic surgery and <span>Botox</span> are frequently discussed on the show, with the majority of the cast members openly discussing any procedures or tweaks they have had. We believe that this is a very positive and refreshing attitude towards plastic surgery, as celebrities and people in the spotlight frequently keep their surgeries hidden, creating false expectations in their fans.</p><p>When you look at old photos of Chrishell Stause, you can see that she has undergone plastic surgery and non-surgical treatments to keep her looking young and in great shape. We think she looks wonderful and hope to see her climb the realtor ladder and sell those million-dollar homes in the future!</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-chrishell-stause-and-g-flip-married></span>Are Chrishell Stause and G Flip Married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It’s hardly surprising that <span>Chrishell Stause</span> and <span>G Flip</span> (<span>@gflip</span>)are still together considering how they got their thigh tattooed, how intensely they PDA at glam events, how they acknowledged that this relationship had shown them a different side of themselves, and how strongly they support and love each other.</p><p>There were concerns that distance would come between them because G Flip is an Australian musician and frequently on tour, but the couple has managed their schedules admirably — they make efforts to travel to each other and maintain communication via calls or messages.</p><p>The fact that Chrishell and G secretly married in Las Vegas shortly after their first dating anniversary, in March 2023, is the clearest indication of their ongoing romance. They actually announced the same thing on May 10 while promoting, <span>Be Your Man,</span> the song the G has written for their partner in relation to gender as well as sexuality, indicating that they are relationship goals through and through.</p><p>In a recent exclusive <span>interview</span> with <span>People</span>, Chrishell&nbsp; Stause stated,&nbsp; “It was a very small group there with us and some friends and family watching on a live stream.”&nbsp; She went on to say that an Elvis Presley impersonator performed the wedding. She also said that they married a little while ago, but are keeping the exact date private for the time being so that they can really enjoy the reality behind it all.</p><p>What we do know from Season 7 of the show is that the happy ceremony took place prior to the opening of The Oppenheim Group’s new office in Los Angeles, California, as the couple had been waiting to share the news with the rest of the cast members.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJuYp7a0tMSlo2arpJbCtLGMm5yfp6KaeqK6w2aYn6yVp3qxuMCsq6KbXajCs7PEq7Bmpp9iuqK3xK6nZqSfpLhuu8Vmq6GdXaiyrbjIp55mq6WjwKbAjJqjrqVdmsWiucinnJ1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
