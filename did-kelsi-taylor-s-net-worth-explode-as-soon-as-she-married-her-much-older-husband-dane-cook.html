However, she is only in her early 20s. She seems to have been working steadily for a long time, though. According to her Instagram bio, she teaches Pilates at various studios in Los Angeles including Mighty Pilates LA, The Pilates Class Studio, and Heated Room.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor's salary is unknown. It's possible that, like many workout teachers, she is paid per class rather than a monthly or annual salary. But, since she has an Instagram following of almost 50,000 people, she could be earning money from her social media presence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kelsi-taylor.jpg><p>According to Yahoo!

Pamela Reif has 6 million followers, which allows her to charge $46,050.55 for a post.</p><p>Kayla Itsines, for example, has 12.6 million followers and makes $60,615.80 when she posts. In contrast, someone like Taylor who has 50,000 followers might be able to charge a few thousand dollars for a post.

But mostly, we were very early making jokes where I would say something like, 'I'd love to have a family,' and she would say, 'Oh, I'd love to have a family when I'm young,' and I'd say, 'Well, I'd like that as well because I'd like to hold my children on my death bed.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also explained to People, "Being able to poke fun at it and have some jokes at our own expense, I think it prepared us for what was going to happen. Which is people were going to put us as a target, so if we make the joke first and we're laughing at it, you can't really hurt us with that."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/dane-cook-kelsi-taylor.jpg><p>Although people might judge the age gap between Dane Cook and Kelsi Taylor, the pair doesn't appear to mind. From the recent photos that Taylor has posted on her Instagram, she seems to only have great memories of their wedding day, and she cares a lot about her husband. They both seem to be thinking about the future. In 2022, Cook spoke to People about starting a family with his then-fiance and said, “I can’t wait, to be very honest with you. I’m just excited at the possibility.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinqSjnnq1rdilpqtlnprBbsPOq6uhZZGbwaa%2BjKaYq6qZmrFuudScn2annJmys3nHrqqbmZ6ZeqWtzZ5knKefoHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
