Then you get sisters and brothers. I know it’s probably not going to happen, but that’s my ideal.”</p><p>Adoption was her husband’s plan in the first place, Giudici told Us, admitting that he “promoted it.” She explained, “He always wanted to adopt. I have no problems with that. I think it will be a beautiful family. We’ll see what happens.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Catherine-Giudici-Shares-Sweet-Meaning-Behind-Newborn-Daughter-Mia%E2%80%99s-Middle-Name-3.jpg><p>The former reality stars met and fell in love on season 17 of <a href=#>The Bachelor </a>and tied the knot on live television in January 2014.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think the funny thing is, is a lot of times, Catherine and I have to stop and remind each other that we met on&nbsp;The Bachelor&nbsp;and it just seems so absurd because we’re so normal,” Lowe told Us in February. “We don’t do a lot of the&nbsp;Bachelor&nbsp;functions and get-togethers and parties that a lot of those Bachelor alums do. It’s really easy for us because we’re just a regular, married couple with kids.”</p><p>Giudici chimed in, “I think<a href=#> we don’t even think of ourselves as a Bachelor couple</a> in that way, anymore. We’re so normal and we’re just living a wonderful life as parents to new kids.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacmaSdsrO1zZ5koKGlmbaktYysn5qqlah6rrHAp6Cnn12Xsqm1zZ1knZmlnLW1sdFmpKKZo2K6qrDDpZxmppGisnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
