But it's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Bennifer reunion</a> that's got people the most divided. It wasn't that long since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez split</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of fans are somewhat bothered by the fact that first, JLo, a stunning bombshell got back with an ex. Second, they think she's a grown woman with two kids who should know better. Third, well many fans think the public display of affection is just corny. Here's what fans truly think about <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lopez</a> </strong>and Ben Affleck's current relationship.&nbsp;</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Jennifer Lopez To Star In Netflix Sci-Fi Movie, Here's What Fans Can Expect" href=#>Jennifer Lopez To Star In Netflix Sci-Fi Movie, Here's What Fans Can Expect</a></span></p><h2 id=they-think-it-s-too-much-for-jlo-s-kids>They Think&nbsp;It's Too Much For JLo's Kids</h2><p>Rumors are that JLo is already house-hunting in Los Angeles to live closer to Ben Affleck. She's also been looking at schools for her twins. It's quite a swift and big move, right? Well, some fans aren't shocked anymore. They say that at this point, they're already used to the Let's Get Loud&nbsp;singer&nbsp;not managing to be single for a long time. However, many fans have expressed their concerns for the singer's children with ex-husband Marc Anthony.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The kids have been out a lot with Affleck. Fans worry that it's too soon to be introducing yet another stepfather that might not stick around long. Those are pretty valid concerns, for sure. Some fans even cited that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">JLo's daughter dying her hair blue</a>&nbsp;and cutting her hair might be a sign of distress. Many people on Twitter are calling out the 51-year-old singer for being so "vain" and "conceited" for parading her love life in public with the kids around.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Here’s Who Is Actually Behind The Iconic Couple Name, 'Bennifer'" href=#>Here’s Who Is Actually Behind The Iconic Couple Name, 'Bennifer'</a></span></p><h2 id=fans-think-it-s-a-pr-stunt>Fans Think It's A PR Stunt</h2><p>This is an interesting theory. We all know how Hollywood tends to go overboard with these publicity stunts. But to do all this just to promote the&nbsp;Selena&nbsp;star's&nbsp;new movie? Does she even need the extra hype? Well, if this isn't a PR stunt, getting back with an ex under her specific circumstances is still not looking good. If it really is, that's still not the best thing to expose the kids to. Also, way to break the fans' hearts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many skeptics on Twitter are starting to wonder why the couple has been getting caught in such perfect moments. For instance, they think all those smooching pictures have got to be staged. Either Bennifer doesn't care anymore about locking lips so shamelessly in public or their PR company orchestrated everything. We'll probably know more once that movie comes out.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="JLo's Mom 'Keeps An Eye' On Ben Affleck As The Recovering Addict Hits Casino" href=#>JLo's Mom 'Keeps An Eye' On Ben Affleck As The Recovering Addict Hits Casino</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wendy-williams-also-thinks-it-s-too-much>Wendy Williams Also Thinks It's Too Much</h2><p>Wendy Williams showed this video of&nbsp;Bennifer making out in public during her Hot Topics segment in The Wendy Williams Show. Williams said that with all that "slobbing down," they should get a room. It was during JLo's sister Lynda Lopez's birthday, after all. The talk show host agrees that it looks staged as well. Williams pointed out how "aggressive" JLo was in grabbing the&nbsp;Justice League star's head, obviously not hiding behind the bushes and proving that it wasn't at all spontaneous PDA.</p><p>Of course, she also weighed in on the fans' concerns about the children. "I just think it's all too soon,?" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wendy Williams said on her show</a>. "You know these kids are too young to be meeting mom's new boo thing. They don't really know who Ben is. Like they weren't even born at that particular time." The talk show added that this is not a nice image for the pop star's kids to see—"all making out and flipping men all the time." Like the supervising producer of the show, Norman Baker told Williams, she is not wrong...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Jennifer Lopez Trolled For 'Stealing' Ashanti's Vocals As She Celebrates First Album" href=#>Jennifer Lopez Trolled For 'Stealing' Ashanti's Vocals As She Celebrates First Album</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dp7Kiv86nZJ%2BZnqh6or7EZpqroZ6ctq%2BzjJqZqK2kYsGpsYybnKemmZuys3nRnqynoZ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
