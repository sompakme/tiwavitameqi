Rose, who’s currently in Austin, TX for the 2016 SXSW festival promoting her new 3D character MUVA, spoke on what she thinks are the double standards society places on women like Rose and West, and the passes it gives to Beyonce.</p><p>“They come at me and Kim so hard because I was a stripper and she had a sex tape,” Rose said in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Daily Beast</a>. “So if we could sing, it would be OK if we were on stage half-naked. We all love <a href=# id=auto-tag_beyonce_1 data-tag=beyonce>Beyoncé</a>, but she’s on stage half-naked and twerking all the time, yet people say, oh, she has talent so she’s able to do that. We don’t have the talent that Beyoncé has, so we get criticized as former sex workers, but at the end of the day we’re just women—we’re all women—and we should all embrace each other. No one is greater.”</p><p>After Rose publicly defended West, she said she invited her to her second annual Slut Walk and while she says the likelihood of the two becoming friends is slim, she’s still open to the idea of attending.</p><p>“The thing is, me and Kim will probably—I won’t say we’ll <i>never</i> be friends, but we accept each other for who we are, and that’s the most important thing as women,” says Rose. “I don’t get along with her husband—I don’t think we’ll ever be the best of friends—but it’s good that we understand who we both are, got all that shit out on the table, and can just move on with our lives knowing that the Internet is mostly what gave us the beef we had. We didn’t naturally have any beef with each other, the Internet just naturally instigated everything. So we got it all out and it’s all good now.”</p><p>Rose maintains she respects Beyonce as a woman and entertainer, but doesn’t agree with the pass the “Formation” singer gets, and the criticism she and Kim receives.</p><p>“We’re all the same. So, to criticize us as incapable of being smart businesswomen because Kim has a reality show and I’m a socialite and we don’t sing is stupid. We’ve both been in movies, and we take our acting, business ventures, and everything else <i>very</i> seriously.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a6o7HRZqmoq5ViuKq5jKSYq5yRqLWqrc1mmZ6xn6OwpnmTamdwbmZk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
