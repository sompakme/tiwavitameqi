CCTV footage helped authorities identify Enrique Arochi, a one-time acquaintance of Morris, as the prime suspect in her disappearance.&nbsp;</p><p>The two were seen walking together and entering a parking lot in the early morning, which was the last time Morris was alive.&nbsp;</p><p>Arochi was eventually found guilty of kidnapping based on solid evidence linking him to the case, and the search for Morris continued. In 2018, her skeletal remains were found in a wooded area in Anna, Texas.</p><p>At the time of her disappearance, Morris was back in her hometown of Plano for the Labor Day weekend. She was last seen near The Shops at Legacy at 3:55 am on August 30, 2014.&nbsp;</p><p>Three days later, her car was found in a parking garage, but no sign of her. Hunter Foster, Morris’ then-boyfriend, was initially suspected of involvement in her disappearance.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, authorities dismissed him as a suspect after searching through mobile phone data, toll road records, and speaking with witnesses.</p><p>As the leads regarding Morris’ whereabouts dwindled, her family, friends, and loved ones continued to search for her every week, focusing their efforts on Anna, a small town with farmlands.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, construction workers found her partial skeletal remains in a field in the town. The cause of death was either not determined or has not been made public.</p><p>When investigators found Morris’ car, they reviewed the surveillance tapes from the parking lot and noticed that she entered the location with a male. The male was identified as Enrique Gutierrez Arochi, an acquaintance from high school.&nbsp;</p><p>Friends reported that Arochi was romantically interested in Morris, but she was not reciprocating. One friend noted that Arochi looked almost angry when he offered to walk.&nbsp;</p><p>Morris went to her car after she announced she wanted to head home. They went into the garage, but only Arochi drove out three minutes later.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCvx6ugrKyZo65uuc6rqaKrXaLCs7DEq2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
