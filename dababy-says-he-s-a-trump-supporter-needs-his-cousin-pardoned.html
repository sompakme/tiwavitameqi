DaBaby disclosed he would’ve voted for Kanye West in the 2020 election because he feels “Ye is a gangsta.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The hosts took the conversation up a controversial notch, asking Kirk about his thoughts on Donald Trump, whom DaBaby says he now respects because he released Kodak Black from prison.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Do I f**k with Trump? Now? Hell yeah. Trump is a gangsta. Ni**a let Kodak out,” the&nbsp;Baby on Baby&nbsp;rapper expressed.&nbsp;“And I need him to get my cousin out…yeah, in California…[If] you need your new campaign partner, Trump, when you come back around, holla at me, man. We can swap it out, get my cousin out…he’s a political prisoner. We’ll get to that later, Trump.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">And DaBaby isn’t the only rapper who has pledged allegiance to former President Donald Trump in recent memory.

The Florida rapper was in the middle of serving a 46-month sentence after being convicted of a 2019 federal weapons charge.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I Want To Thank The President @RealDonaldTrump For His Commitment To Justice Reform And Shortening My Sentence,” Kodak Black tweeted, thanking Trump in 2021. “I Also Want To Thank Everyone For Their Support And Love. It Means More Than You Will Ever Know. I Want To Continue Giving Back, Learning And Growing.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Elsewhere, DaBaby recently released a collaborative project with NBA Youngboy, entitled&nbsp;BETTER THAN YOU,&nbsp;on March 4, 2022.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kodak Black was released from prison a year ago today by Donald Trump ?</p><p>Kodak had one of the biggest comeback since & his hit song “Super Gremlin” is currently #6 on the charts! <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/ANYw4dexw4</a></p>— My Mixtapez (@mymixtapez) <a href=# rel=nofollow>January 20, 2022</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The joint effort featured production from BlakeSale, Cardo, Johnny Juliano, Yung Exclusive, Leor, TnTXD, Ambezza, Uzoh, and Kayothewizard, and more.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch the entire DaBaby’s responses below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5muo63BsmStqqWivW6%2F1KmnqKqkmr9uusSem6xlk6TCtLXNZqeaqpSku6awjGppbGxmbX15fpFo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
