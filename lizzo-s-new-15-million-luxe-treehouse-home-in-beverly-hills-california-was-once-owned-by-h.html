She just dropped $15 million on a luxe Beverly Hills house previously owned by her pal Harry Styles.</p><p>Hard to believe it’s been only three years since Lizzo first came to prominence. Since then, the Grammy-winning, bestselling and occasionally controversial rapper and songwriter has accumulated a global fanbase that stands millions strong, had a song and album reach #1 on the Billboard charts, and released an apparel brand and an Emmy-winning TV program. And now the 34-year-old has upgraded her home life from Echo Park to the 90210, where records reveal she’s bought a rather stunning estate once owned by her close friend Harry Styles, per <a href=#><i>Dirt</i></a>.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b>Lizzo Has Been Invited To Perform At James Madison's House In Virginia After She Played His Flute</b></a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Squirreled away within a remote gated community high in the mountains above Beverly Hills, the oak tree-studded property has a very musical provenance. It was the first stateside home ever bought by Styles, who lived there from 2014-2016. But he sold the place at a million-dollar loss to husband-and-wife team Simo Design, who have also built homes now owned by Jon Hamm and Nicole Richie. The team subsequently collaborated with Fischer Construction to replace the demolished Styles house with a much larger and significantly more stylish mansion.</p><p>According to <i>Dirt, </i>The modernist, 5,300-square-foot structure resembles a luxe treehouse. Completed in 2019, the new home was sold for $11 million to Aaron Bay-Schuck, a longtime music executive and the current CEO of Warner Records. After living there for less than three years and making few changes to the house, Bay-Schuck flipped it to Lizzo for exactly $15 million. (Bay-Schuck has upgraded to a $22 million Beverly Hills estate previously owned by Sofia Richie.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Set behind two layers of walls and gates, the residence offers three bedrooms, three full bathrooms and two powder rooms. A pivoting front door opens into a double-height foyer, and there’s also a fig tree ensconced in an open-air atrium that pierces the middle of the home. From there, natural light seeps into most of the main floor spaces, including the minimalist formal dining and living rooms.</p><p>The kitchen blends a striking quartzite stone with oil-rubbed walnut cabinetry; other organic material applications include a bookcase hewn from ceramic brick and Ipe wood balconies. Upstairs, a breezeway with walls of glass leads into the nearly 1,000-square-foot master suite, which offers a lavish bedroom and bathroom divided by a floor-to-ceiling marble slab wall. There’s also a “floating” soapstone fireplace, plus a concrete soaking tub and walk-in closet with a glass-topped island.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lizzo hasn’t been shy about showing off her new digs. The Detroit-born, Houston-bred “Truth Hurts” sensation has posted photos and videos displaying her twerking up a storm, enjoying amenities that include a soundproof movie theater, grassy lawns and multiple wooden decks for outdoor entertaining. But perhaps the property’s most interesting feature is the 58-foot infinity pool, which flows directly underneath the master bedroom suite to the cliff’s edge, directly overlooking the oak tree-filled canyons below.</p><p>Other highlights include the kitchen, which boasts a massive solid stone quartzite island and walnut cabinetry, a movie theater resembling a chic high-tech cave replete with a fireplace, multiple decks and terraces, and a 58-foot infinity pool with canyon views.</p><p>Many of Lizzo’s nearest new neighbors are also big-name celebrities — among them Lisa Vanderpump, Jessica Alba, Demi Moore and Jon Voight.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>Aaron Donald, Jaylen Brown Reportedly Leaving Donda Sports After Kanye West’s Anti-Semitic Remarks</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Architectural Digest</a>, <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaloaqvvLR5zZ6uZmllYrqquMuipqdlnKrFpnnTq5yeoJ%2BqwKZ5x6iknmWZo3qjsdWeqaWxXZ22rbjSZpqapJmbvLO6yJpksJmjYryvr8RmprCmlZl6o8WMoZirqqliwLXFy56qaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
