The billionaire reportedly auctioned off thousands in old Twitter memorabilia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Heritage Global Partners, an asset disposal firm, oversaw the auction that saw a number of mementos from Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters go up for auction.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kanye West Marries In Secret Ceremony, Flaunts Pricey Wedding Ring</a></span></p><p>The auction didn’t only have kitschy items, but everything including “<a href=#>kitchen equipment, electronics, furniture</a>” and more.</p><p>The most expensive item sold at the auction was reportedly a 4-foot statue of Twitter’s bird logo. <a href=#>The buyer paid $100,000 for the neon piece</a> , even though it was originally commission for $17,000.</p><p>Other notable pieces that sold include a food dehydrator, a pizza oven, and three beer kegs, all of which sold for over $10,000 a piece.There were also several soundproof phone booths that auctioned off for $4,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elon hasn’t been shy about Twitter’s financial problems since acquiring the platform in aa $44 billion deal in October.</p><p>In November, the billionaire defended his decision to fire half of Twitter’s employees in an effort to cut costs immediately after taking over, implying he barely had a choice.</p><p>"<a href=#>Regarding Twitter's reduction in force</a>, unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over $4M/day,” he tweeted.</p><p>In another effort to make Twitter profitable, Elon introduced a paid version of the site. This gives users a variety of special privileges, including a blue verification checkmark. But this has also made it easier to impersonate other accounts.</p><p>Elon bought Twitter to <a href=#>open it up to absolute free speech</a>. He’s loosened restrictions on what can and cannot be said, and reinstated controversial accounts, i<a href=#>ncluding for former U.S. President Donald Trump</a>, who was banned from Twitter after using it to encourage the Capitol riots.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The businessman’s changes to the platform have caused many advertisers to sever ties with Twitter, decreasing its monthly revenue.</p><p>Additionally, many users (both famous and other) have deactivated their accounts.</p><p>Twitter’s financial problems may be catching up to them, which would explain the need to sell off mundane items, like mementos. Earlier this month, Twitter was hit with a <a href=#>lawsuit after it fell two months behind on rent</a> at its San Francisco office, totalling $136,260 in debt.</p><p>Elon has also received criticism for selling a significant portion of Tesla shares to seemingly fund the Twitter buyout. Of the $36 billion in shares he’s offloaded, half have been since acquiring Twitter – and he’s even made several sales since swearing last summer he wouldn’t do anymore.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Tesla Investors Claim Elon Musk’s Tweets Cost Them Billions</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>HGP Auctions</a>, <a href=#>Forbes</a>, <a href=#>Business Insider</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSyrbvNZqSuq5tiwKa4y6xkqKSUYsG4tdOtnKtlnZq6sL7Am6CloZFirrR5wqikqZmernqpscyoqaugkZyytHnMoqOloZ%2BjwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
