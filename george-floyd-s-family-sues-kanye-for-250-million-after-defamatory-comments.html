Her attorneys also served Ye with a cease-and-desist order.</p><p>“ <a href=#>Mr. Floyd’s cause of death</a> is well-settled through evidence presented in courts of law during the criminal and civil trials that were the result of his untimely and horrific death,” it said.&nbsp; “Nevertheless, you have maliciously made statements that are inaccurate and unfounded, causing damage to Mr. Floyd’s estate and his family.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They’re now suing Kanye for "<a href=#>harassment, misappropriation, defamation and infliction</a> of emotional distress seeking $250 million dollars in damages” another statement from Roxie’s legal representatives said.</p><p>During the same Drinks Champs interview (which has been removed by YouTube), Kanye made a series of antisemitic comments.
