Some of them we will never be forgotten, but many of them may not likely be remembered unless we are reminded of them. There are certainly less WWE Divas than there are male superstars, but they still come and go with time. With only a handful of Divas in the WWE at any given time, these ladies are under a lot of pressure to perform and entertain the millions (and millions!) of fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many of the Divas on the list had successful careers and captured gold on at least one occasion. Some of them tried their hand at acting and other pursuits, while others have decided to focus on staying home and raising their children. Take a stroll down memory lane with these 20 forgotten WWE Divas and find out where they are now.</p><h2 id=20-victoria><strong>20.
