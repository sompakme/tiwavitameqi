Known for being shot nine times, he was raised by his grandparents in New York’s South Jamaica, Queens. He originally worked with Columbia Records, but ties were severed because of his unpopular rough and tough image. His popularity surged in 2003 when <a href=#><strong>Eminem</strong></a> signed him to his record label which is tied to Interscope. That same year, Jackson came out with his debut album, Get Rich or Die Tryin, which broke records by selling over 15 million copies worldwide.</p><p>His singles like “In Da Club,” “Wanksta,” “Candy Shop,” and “Disco Inferno” are just a few of his solo hits, but he’s also collaborated with many other acclaimed rappers. He also started his own label, G-Unit Records, that manages <strong>Tony</strong> <strong>Yayo</strong> and <strong>Lloyd</strong> <strong>Banks</strong>.</p><p>When he’s not performing, Jackson maintains the 50 Cent brand. The rapper has a five-year deal with Reebok, his own Vitamin Water flavor, launched a body spray with Right Guard, started a condom line called Magic Stick Condoms, published an autobiography, and has an acting career.</p><p>Jackson has one son, Marquise Jackson, with former girlfriend <strong>Shaniqua</strong> <strong>Tompkins</strong>. In 2010, he dated comedienne <a href=#><strong>Chelsea</strong> <strong>Handler</strong></a>.</p><span>More ▾</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxnZWV6pLHNrWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
