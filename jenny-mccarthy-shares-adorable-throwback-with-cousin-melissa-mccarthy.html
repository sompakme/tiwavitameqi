Jenny helped Melissa get her first job when she was leading the sitcom Jenny, which ran from 1997 to 1998. Since then, both actresses have become famous and successful in their own rights.</p><p>The two cousins, who spent their childhood years together with their expansive family, remain on good terms but are rarely seen in public together. Melissa didn’t even attend Jenny’s small wedding to <strong>Donnie Wahlberg </strong>last year. <a href=# rel=noopener>She told </a><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Howard Stern</a> </strong>that she and her cousin are in “opposite worlds” these days.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Jenny has shifted her focus a bit in recent years, acting less and making more appearances as herself on shows like The View, Donnie Loves Jenny, and Wahlburgers. For her part, Melissa has become a celebrated force in the comedy world, leading flicks like Spy, Tammy, and The Heat. She’ll also star alongside <strong>Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon</strong>, and <strong>Leslie Jones</strong> in the upcoming Ghostbusters reboot.</p><p>The stars both have families of their own now, too. Jenny has a 13-year-old son named <strong>Evan</strong> from her first marriage to<strong> John Mallory Asher</strong>, while Melissa and her husband <strong>Ben Falcone</strong> are the parents to daughters <strong>Vivian</strong>, 8, and <strong>Georgette</strong>, 5.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ6jxm65wpyYq6yYrnq0tMCrnKxlkZm8s63BpZxmrJinvLiuwJyiZq%2BZqbVur86uqqKmXaKyrbXSrJhmpZOYrrPAx7Jka2hhaoByg44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
