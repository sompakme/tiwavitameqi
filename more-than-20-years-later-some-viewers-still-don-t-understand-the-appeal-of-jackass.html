The follow-up, Jackass 4.5 has raced into the list of Netflix Top Ten. Even though the original cast members are now in their 50s, they still have a huge following. Plus, the franchise has a growing fan base amongst the 18-34-year-old group.</p><h2 id=some-people-wonder-why-jackass-is-so-popular>Some People Wonder Why Jackass Is So Popular</h2><p>Posting on Reddit, a viewer asked: “I've been trying to get into the Jackass movies, but I just can't. I've been told that these were hysterical by close friends, but I really don't think I get it. Is it an ironic appreciation or is it sincere? Do people view this as genuinely funny slapstick or does the humor derive more from the shock of watching somebody do something gross/dangerous?”</p><p>The answers were varied. While some fans said that a feeling of nostalgia is what keeps them going back for each sequel, others just love it for what it is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-makes-jackass-so-funny-for-some>What Makes Jackass So Funny For Some?</h2><p>Jackass in all its permutations has been called outrageous, indecent, and disgustingly gross, but yet its appeal continues.</p><p>One Redditor has this to say: “I've outgrown it to some extent, but the cast has a likable quality because they are just down for whatever if they think it will get a laugh. It's a totally unpretentious embrace of all things idiotic, dangerous, and ridiculous. The key is that they're in on the joke, and they never seemed to get an ego or lose the spirit of what made it fun in the first place."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Guys Of 'Jackass' Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Jackass has never pretended to be clever comedy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As another response read: “It's dumb fun that doesn't take itself seriously. I still remember seeing the first episode on MTV when it debuted. It was an immediate Wow, WTF is this?. There just hadn't been anything quite like it on mainstream TV yet.”</p><p>Perhaps part of the appeal is the total irreverence around the concept.</p><h2 id=some-clues-may-lie-in-how-jackass-began>Some Clues May Lie In How Jackass Began</h2><p>Before the blockbuster movies, there was a hit series. The initial idea was based on a concept by actor Johnny Knoxville.

In a time before cell phones, fans unable to film themselves trying out crazy stunts loved watching someone else performing them.</p><p>Joined by Hollywood director Spike Jonze, the team decided to use the concept for a TV show. Networks were interested, with one offer from Saturday Night Live, which would see a weekly slot of the team’s antics. But MTV’s offer was more appealing, their own 25-minute shows.</p><p>Jackass premiered on MTV in October 2000, and became an instant success.

The programs carried a warning for viewers, urging them not to try and to duplicate what they saw on screen. Despite that, there were a number of instances where viewers, especially <a href=#>young kids, were hurt and even killed, trying to copy stunts</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The third season was shot under strict control by a representative of the Occupational Health and Safety Administration.

The stars have suffered multiple concussions, fractured skulls, broken bones, burns and more, all in the name of entertainment.
