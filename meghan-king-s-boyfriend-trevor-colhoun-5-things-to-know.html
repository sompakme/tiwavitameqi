This situation is profoundly devastating,” she wrote via her Instagram Story at the time. “This is obviously not what I imagined when I made my vows — and I’m shocked and saddened by the way things turned out. I am moving forward with my children as we privately process our pain and begin to let go of shattered dreams.”</p><p>King was previously married to <a href=#><strong>Jim Edmonds</strong></a>, her second husband, and shares <a href=#>three children</a> him: Aspen, born in 2016, and twins Hayes and Hart, born in 2018. The Missouri native and the former baseball player wed in October 2014 and <a href=#>finalized their divorce</a> in May 2021. King <a href=#>accused Edmonds of having an affair</a> while they were still together, which he denied.</p><p>After she and the former center fielder split, <a href=#>the blogger opened up</a> about wanting to find love again during a January 2020 episode of her podcast, “Intimate Knowledge.”</p><p>“I just want a partner, right? I just want somebody who’s supporting me and isn’t jealous or trying to suppress,” she shared. “You know, somebody who grows with me — instead of, like, staying stagnant at a certain place. Like, to me that’s intimacy. I just need that partner next to me who’s gonna hold my hand.”</p><p>Prior to her relationship with Edmonds, the University of Mississippi graduate was married to lawyer <strong>Brad McDill</strong>. The duo legally separated in October 2011.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I was too young. I didn’t even know myself,” King told Page Six of <a href=#>her first marriage</a> in July 2019. “I wanted to be like my parents’ perfect marriage. I just thought I was going to have the same love story, because why not? I’ve done everything else like my parents, so why wouldn’t it work out?”</p><p>Scroll through for everything you need to know about Colhoun, the reality TV alum’s new love interest:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqazx5qlZqOZo7S0ecGosJ%2BqmZq7pXnTq5yvp6JisLC4x6isp2VlYsGptc2gqmasn2K4r7vWaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
